### Materials and Methods

#### Materials
- **Inorganic Materials**: Choose suitable nanoparticles such as:
  - **Metal oxides**: Titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), silica (SiO2)
  - **Noble metals**: Gold (AuNPs), silver (AgNPs)
- **Organic Materials**: Select polymers or organic compounds such as:
  - **Natural polymers**: Chitosan, gelatin, alginate
  - **Synthetic polymers**: Polylactic acid (PLA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
- **Reagents**: Solvents (e.g., ethanol, water), surfactants, crosslinking agents.

#### Synthesis of Hybrid Nanomaterials

1. **Preparation of Inorganic Nanoparticles**:
   - **Synthesize nanoparticles** using appropriate methods (e.g., chemical reduction for metal nanoparticles, sol-gel method for metal oxides).
   - Characterize nanoparticles using techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to assess size and morphology.

2. **Preparation of Organic Polymer Solutions**:
   - Dissolve the selected organic polymer in a suitable solvent at the desired concentration.
   - If needed, modify the polymer chemically or physically (e.g., through crosslinking or functionalization) to enhance compatibility with the inorganic phase.

3. **Hybrid Nanomaterial Synthesis**:
   - **Mixing Method**:
     - Add inorganic nanoparticles to the organic polymer solution and stir thoroughly to ensure uniform dispersion.
   - **Solvent Evaporation**:
     - Cast the mixture into a mold and allow the solvent to evaporate to form a solid hybrid material.
   - **Coating Method**:
     - Alternatively, coat the inorganic nanoparticles with the organic polymer using techniques like electrospinning or layer-by-layer assembly.

4. **Crosslinking (if applicable)**:
   - If using a crosslinking agent, treat the hybrid material to stabilize the organic and inorganic phases.
