### Procedure:

#### Step 1: Design of the Filtration System

1. **Layering the Filtration Medium:**
   - **Bottom Layer**: Place a layer of activated carbon nanoparticles at the bottom of the filtration container. This layer will help in adsorbing organic contaminants and improving taste and odor.
   - **Middle Layer**: Add a layer of graphene oxide to act as a membrane for size exclusion filtration. This layer can help remove small particles and contaminants from the water.
   - **Top Layer**: Place a layer of silver nanoparticles embedded in a support matrix to provide antimicrobial action against any bacterial contamination.
   - Optional: Include a layer of zinc oxide nanoparticles above the silver layer for photocatalytic activity under UV light.

2. **Assembly:**
   - Ensure that the layers are firmly packed and do not mix. Use mesh or cloth to separate layers if needed.
   - Fit the container with a lid and appropriate outlets for water to flow through.

#### Step 2: Water Contaminant Preparation

1. **Prepare Contaminated Water Samples:**
   - Create synthetic contaminated water samples by adding known concentrations of contaminants (e.g., heavy metals, dyes, and bacteria) to distilled water.
   - Use a concentration relevant to real-world scenarios (e.g., heavy metals at 1-10 ppm, bacteria at 10^3 - 10^6 CFU/mL).

---

#### Step 3: Testing the Filtration System

1. **Initial Testing:**
   - Measure the initial concentration of contaminants in the prepared water samples using a spectrophotometer and microbiological analysis.
   - Record the pH of the initial samples.

2. **Filtration Process:**
   - Pass the contaminated water through the constructed filtration system. Ensure that water flows at a controlled rate for uniform contact with the filtration layers.
   - Collect the filtered water in a clean container.

3. **Post-Filtration Testing:**
   - Measure the concentration of contaminants in the filtered water using the same methods as for the initial testing.
   - Compare the results to assess the reduction in contaminants.

### Data Analysis

1. **Calculate Removal Efficiency:**
   - Use the formula for removal efficiency:
     \[
     \text{Removal Efficiency} (\%) = \left( \frac{\text{Initial Concentration} - \text{Final Concentration}}{\text{Initial Concentration}} \right) \times 100
     \]

2. **Analyze Results:**
   - Present data in tables and graphs to illustrate the effectiveness of the filtration system for different contaminants.
   - Include comparisons between initial and post-filtration concentrations.
