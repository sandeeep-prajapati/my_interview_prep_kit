### Experimental Procedure

#### Step 1: Design and Simulation
1. **Design the Device:**
   - Use software like COMSOL Multiphysics, Lumerical FDTD, or CAD tools to design the nanolens or nanoantenna.
   - Define parameters such as diameter, height, and spacing (for nanoantenna arrays).

2. **Simulation:**
   - Simulate the optical response (e.g., resonance frequency, scattering efficiency) of the designed device to optimize dimensions.

#### Step 2: Fabrication Process

##### Option A: Fabricating a Nanolens
1. **Coating:**
   - Spin-coat a photoresist layer onto the cleaned silicon wafer.

2. **Exposure:**
   - Use a mask aligner or EBL to pattern the photoresist according to the nanolens design.

3. **Development:**
   - Develop the photoresist to reveal the nanolens pattern.

4. **Etching:**
   - Perform reactive ion etching (RIE) to transfer the pattern into the underlying silicon wafer.

5. **Removing Photoresist:**
   - Strip the remaining photoresist using a suitable solvent.

##### Option B: Fabricating a Nanoantenna
1. **Deposition:**
   - Deposit a thin layer of gold or silver onto the substrate using sputtering or thermal evaporation.

2. **Patterning:**
   - Follow similar lithography techniques as mentioned above to create patterns for nanoantenna structures.

3. **Etching:**
   - Use wet or dry etching to remove unwanted metal and leave behind the desired nanoantenna structures.

#### Step 3: Characterization

1. **Imaging:**
   - Use SEM or AFM to characterize the morphology and dimensions of the fabricated nanolenses or nanoantennas.

2. **Optical Analysis:**
   - Place the fabricated device in a spectrometer setup.
   - Measure optical properties such as absorbance, transmission, and scattering over a range of wavelengths.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze the spectra obtained to determine key optical properties such as resonance wavelengths and efficiencies.
