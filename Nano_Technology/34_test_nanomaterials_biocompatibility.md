### Materials and Methods

#### Materials
- **Nanomaterials**: Select a range of nanomaterials, such as:
  - **Metal-based nanoparticles**: Gold (AuNPs), silver (AgNPs), iron oxide (Fe3O4)
  - **Polymeric nanoparticles**: PLGA, chitosan
  - **Carbon-based nanomaterials**: Graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
- **Cell Lines**: Use relevant human cell lines for testing, such as:
  - **Fibroblasts** (e.g., L929, NIH 3T3)
  - **Endothelial cells** (e.g., HUVEC)
  - **Cancer cells** (e.g., HeLa, MCF-7)
- **Reagents**: Cell culture media, MTT or Alamar Blue assay kits, annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit, inflammatory cytokine assay kits (e.g., ELISA).

#### Experimental Design

1. **Preparation of Nanomaterials**:
   - Synthesize or acquire nanomaterials and characterize them using techniques such as TEM, SEM, and DLS to assess size, morphology, and dispersion.

2. **Cell Culture**:
   - Culture selected cell lines according to standard protocols in appropriate media supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics.
   - Maintain cells in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C with 5% CO2.

3. **Cytotoxicity Assessment**:
   - **MTT Assay**:
     - Seed cells in 96-well plates at a density of 5,000-10,000 cells/well.
     - Expose cells to various concentrations of nanomaterials (e.g., 0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 µg/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 hours.
     - Add MTT reagent to each well, incubate for 2-4 hours, and measure absorbance at 570 nm to calculate cell viability.
   - **Alamar Blue Assay**:
     - Similar setup as MTT, but add Alamar Blue reagent and measure fluorescence to assess metabolic activity.

4. **Cell Proliferation Assay**:
   - Use the same setup as the cytotoxicity assay but extend the incubation time (e.g., 5-7 days) to observe effects on cell proliferation over time.

5. **Apoptosis Detection**:
   - After exposure to nanomaterials, harvest cells and stain with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) to differentiate between viable, early apoptotic, late apoptotic, and necrotic cells.
   - Analyze using flow cytometry.

6. **Inflammatory Response Assessment**:
   - Culture cells with or without nanomaterials for a defined period.
   - Collect supernatants and measure levels of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions.
