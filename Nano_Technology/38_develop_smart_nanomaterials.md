### Development of a Smart Material that Responds to Environmental Stimuli

#### Introduction
Smart materials are engineered to react to external stimuli such as temperature, pH, light, or mechanical stress. This experiment focuses on creating a smart polymer-based material that responds to temperature and pH changes. The smart material can be used in various applications, including drug delivery systems, sensors, and actuators. This guide outlines the methodology for synthesizing the smart material and analyzing its behavior in response to environmental changes.

### Methodology

#### Step 1: Synthesis of Smart Material
1. **Preparation of Monomer Solution**:
   - Dissolve PNIPAM and acrylic acid in a suitable solvent (e.g., water or DMF) to create a homogeneous solution.
   - The concentration of PNIPAM should be higher than that of acrylic acid to ensure predominant temperature responsiveness.

2. **Add Crosslinking Agent**:
   - Add N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide to the solution to promote crosslinking, ensuring the formation of a three-dimensional network structure.

3. **Initiate Polymerization**:
   - Introduce a radical initiator (e.g., ammonium persulfate) to the monomer solution to initiate polymerization.
   - Heat the solution to approximately 60째C and maintain the temperature for several hours to allow the polymerization reaction to complete.
   - Cool the solution and collect the resulting hydrogel by filtration or centrifugation. Rinse with distilled water to remove unreacted monomers.

#### Step 2: Characterization of Smart Material
1. **Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)**:
   - Analyze the synthesized smart material using FTIR to confirm the functional groups of PNIPAM and acrylic acid, ensuring the presence of the desired chemical bonds.

2. **Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)**:
   - Use DSC to evaluate the thermal properties of the smart material, including the temperature at which the material transitions from hydrophilic to hydrophobic states.

3. **Swelling Ratio Measurement**:
   - Measure the swelling behavior of the smart material in different pH environments (e.g., pH 4, 7, and 10).
   - Calculate the swelling ratio using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Swelling Ratio} = \frac{\text{Wet Weight} - \text{Dry Weight}}{\text{Dry Weight}}
   \]

#### Step 3: Testing Temperature and pH Responsiveness
1. **Temperature Response Testing**:
   - Prepare samples of the smart material and immerse them in distilled water at varying temperatures (e.g., 25째C, 37째C, and 50째C).
   - Observe and document the physical changes in the material, such as size or transparency.

2. **pH Response Testing**:
   - Prepare buffer solutions of varying pH levels (pH 4, 7, and 10) and immerse the smart material samples in each solution.
   - Measure and record the changes in swelling behavior and transparency of the samples over time.

3. **UV-Vis Spectroscopy**:
   - Use a UV-Vis spectrophotometer to assess the optical properties of the smart material in different environmental conditions. Record absorbance and transmittance at specific wavelengths to evaluate changes in optical behavior.

   - Present FTIR spectra, DSC thermograms, and swelling ratio data in graphs and tables, highlighting the characteristics of the synthesized smart material.

2. **Response Analysis**:
   - Summarize findings from temperature and pH response tests, including graphs that show changes in swelling ratio, transparency, and absorbance at different conditions.

3. **Mechanism of Responsiveness**:
   - Discuss the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the temperature and pH responsiveness of the smart material, including hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.
