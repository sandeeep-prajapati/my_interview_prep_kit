### Materials Required:

1. **Materials:**
   - Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) (synthesized or commercially purchased)
   - Target biomolecule (e.g., proteins, DNA, or small molecules)
   - Functionalization agents (e.g., thiol-modified DNA, antibodies, or aptamers)
   - Buffer solutions (e.g., PBS, Tris buffer)
   - Detection reagents (e.g., enzymes or fluorescent labels)
   - Substrate for immobilization (e.g., glass slides, microplates)

2. **Equipment:**
   - Spectrophotometer or UV-Vis spectrometer
   - Fluorescence microscope (optional, for enhanced detection)
   - Microplate reader (if using microplates)
   - Sonicator (for AuNP dispersion)
   - Centrifuge (for purification)

3. **Safety Equipment:**
   - Gloves, goggles, and lab coats

### Procedure:

#### Step 1: Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles (if not purchased)

1. **Citrate Reduction Method:**
   - Prepare a solution of 1 mM gold(III) chloride (AuCl₃) in deionized water.
   - Heat the solution to boiling and add 1% sodium citrate solution dropwise while stirring.
   - Continue stirring for 10-15 minutes until a deep red color indicates the formation of AuNPs.
   - Cool the solution and store it in a dark bottle.

#### Step 2: Functionalization of Gold Nanoparticles

1. **Conjugation:**
   - Disperse AuNPs in a suitable buffer (e.g., PBS).
   - Add a thiol-modified probe (e.g., DNA, antibodies) to the AuNPs to allow covalent attachment through thiol groups.
   - Incubate the mixture for 1-2 hours at room temperature, allowing the probes to bind to the AuNPs.

2. **Purification:**
   - Centrifuge the solution to remove unbound probes and redispersed the conjugated AuNPs in a buffer for use.

#### Step 3: Biosensor Fabrication

1. **Substrate Preparation:**
   - Clean the substrate surface (glass slides or microplates) with piranha solution (a mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide) or using standard cleaning protocols.
   - Rinse with deionized water and dry under nitrogen.

2. **Immobilization of AuNPs:**
   - Drop-cast the functionalized AuNPs onto the cleaned substrate and incubate for a suitable time to allow adsorption.
   - Rinse with buffer to remove unbound AuNPs.

#### Step 4: Detection of Target Biomolecule

1. **Assay Procedure:**
   - Prepare different concentrations of the target biomolecule in buffer.
   - Incubate the biosensor surface with the target biomolecule solution for a fixed time.
   - Rinse the surface with buffer to remove unbound biomolecules.

2. **Signal Generation:**
   - Depending on the detection method, add detection reagents (e.g., enzymatic substrates or fluorescent labels).
   - Measure the response using a spectrophotometer or fluorescence microscope.

### Evaluation of Sensitivity and Specificity

#### Sensitivity Testing

1. **Standard Calibration Curve:**
   - Prepare a series of dilutions of the target biomolecule and measure the optical signal (absorbance or fluorescence) for each concentration.
   - Plot the calibration curve (signal vs. concentration) to determine the limit of detection (LOD).

2. **Repeatability:**
   - Perform multiple measurements for each concentration to assess repeatability and reproducibility.

#### Specificity Testing

1. **Cross-Reactivity Tests:**
   - Test the biosensor with non-target biomolecules (potential interferents) at similar concentrations.
   - Compare the signals generated by the target biomolecule and the non-target biomolecules.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Calculate the specificity ratio (signal from target biomolecule / signal from non-target biomolecule).

---

### Data Analysis

1. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Use statistical software to analyze data for determining LOD, repeatability, and specificity.
   - Report results as mean ± standard deviation for multiple trials.

2. **Interpretation:**
   - Evaluate the calibration curve for linearity and fit to determine the dynamic range.
   - Discuss potential applications based on sensitivity and specificity results.

### Conclusion

The developed gold nanoparticle-based biosensor demonstrates potential for detecting specific biomolecules with high sensitivity and specificity. The evaluation through standard calibration and cross-reactivity tests highlights the biosensor's effectiveness for potential applications in diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety.
