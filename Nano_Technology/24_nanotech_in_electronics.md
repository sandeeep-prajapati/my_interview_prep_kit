---

#### Objective:
To fabricate a nanoscale resistor using a thin film of conductive material and measure its electrical properties, including resistance, current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, and temperature coefficient of resistance.

### Materials and Equipment:

1. **Materials:**
   - Conductive material (e.g., gold (Au), silver (Ag), or carbon nanotubes).
   - Substrate (e.g., silicon wafer, glass).
   - Electron-beam lithography (EBL) resist (e.g., PMMA).
   - Development solvent (e.g., acetone or isopropyl alcohol).
   - Metal deposition source (e.g., thermal evaporator or sputtering system).

2. **Equipment:**
   - Electron microscope (for imaging and measurement).
   - Four-point probe setup (for measuring resistance).
   - Source-measure unit (for I-V characterization).
   - Temperature control unit (optional, for temperature coefficient measurement).

### Fabrication Process:

#### Step 1: Substrate Preparation
1. **Cleaning:**
   - Clean the substrate (silicon wafer or glass) using solvents like acetone and isopropyl alcohol to remove contaminants.

2. **Drying:**
   - Dry the substrate using nitrogen gas or under an infrared lamp.

#### Step 2: Electron-Beam Lithography (EBL)
1. **Spin Coating:**
   - Spin-coat a thin layer of PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) on the substrate to form a resist layer (thickness around 200 nm).

2. **Soft Baking:**
   - Soft bake the PMMA film on a hot plate at around 180°C for 1-2 minutes to remove the solvent.

3. **Patterning:**
   - Use an electron-beam lithography system to write the desired pattern for the resistor on the PMMA layer.

4. **Development:**
   - Develop the pattern by immersing the substrate in a suitable developer solution (e.g., MIBK:IPA 1:3) for several minutes, followed by rinsing with isopropyl alcohol and drying.

#### Step 3: Metal Deposition
1. **Metal Evaporation:**
   - Deposit a thin layer of the conductive material (e.g., gold or silver) onto the patterned substrate using a thermal evaporator or sputtering system. Aim for a thickness of 20-100 nm.

2. **Lift-off:**
   - Immerse the substrate in a solvent (e.g., acetone) to dissolve the PMMA and lift off the excess metal, leaving only the nanoscale resistor pattern on the substrate.

#### Step 4: Characterization
1. **Morphological Analysis:**
   - Use scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize the morphology of the fabricated resistor.

2. **Resistance Measurement:**
   - Connect the four-point probe setup to the resistor to measure the resistance accurately. This method reduces the impact of contact resistance.

3. **I-V Characterization:**
   - Use a source-measure unit to apply a range of voltages across the resistor and measure the resulting current to create the I-V characteristic curve.

4. **Temperature Coefficient of Resistance (TCR) Measurement:**
   - If desired, vary the temperature of the resistor using a temperature control unit and repeat the resistance measurement to determine the temperature coefficient of resistance.

### Data Analysis:

1. **Resistance Calculation:**
   - Calculate the resistance (R) using Ohm's law from the measured current and voltage:
     \[
     R = \frac{V}{I}
     \]
   - Average the resistance from multiple measurements to account for variability.

2. **I-V Curve Analysis:**
   - Plot the current (I) versus voltage (V) data to obtain the I-V characteristic curve, and calculate the slope to find the resistance at different voltage levels.

3. **Temperature Coefficient of Resistance:**
   - Calculate the temperature coefficient (α) using the formula:
     \[
     \alpha = \frac{R(T_2) - R(T_1)}{R(T_1)(T_2 - T_1)}
     \]
   - Analyze how resistance changes with temperature.
