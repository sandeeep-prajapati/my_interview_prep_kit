### Procedure:

#### Step 1: Design of the Photonic Crystal Structure

1. **Select the Photonic Crystal Design:**
   - Choose a simple lattice structure, such as a 2D square lattice or a 3D face-centered cubic lattice.
   - Determine the periodicity (a) of the lattice and the refractive index (n) of the materials to be used.

2. **Modeling the Structure:**
   - Use software like COMSOL Multiphysics or MATLAB to simulate the optical properties (bandgap, transmission, reflection) of the designed photonic crystal.
   - Optimize parameters such as lattice constant, filling ratio, and layer thickness for desired optical properties.

#### Step 2: Fabrication of the Photonic Crystal

1. **Preparation of Substrate:**
   - Clean the substrate using solvents (like acetone and isopropanol) to remove any contaminants.
   - Dry the substrate using nitrogen gas.

2. **Photoresist Application:**
   - Spin-coat a layer of photoresist onto the substrate using a spin coater to achieve a uniform thickness (typically 1-5 Âµm).
   - Pre-bake the photoresist to remove solvents.

3. **Photolithography Process:**
   - Expose the photoresist to UV light through a photomask designed with the desired lattice pattern.
   - Post-exposure bake the substrate to enhance the reaction in the exposed regions.

4. **Development:**
   - Immerse the substrate in a developer solution to wash away the unexposed regions, leaving the patterned photoresist.

5. **Etching:**
   - Use reactive ion etching or wet etching to transfer the pattern into the underlying material, creating the photonic crystal structure.
   - Remove the remaining photoresist after etching.

6. **Characterization of Fabricated Structure:**
   - Use Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) or Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to analyze the morphology and confirm the quality of the fabricated photonic crystal.

#### Step 3: Optical Properties Measurement

1. **Setup for Optical Measurement:**
   - Place the fabricated photonic crystal in the optical measurement setup.
   - Align the light source to illuminate the photonic crystal and couple the light into the spectrometer.

2. **Conduct Optical Measurements:**
   - Measure the reflection and transmission spectra of the photonic crystal over a range of wavelengths using the spectrometer.
   - Record data at different angles of incidence if the properties are angle-dependent.

3. **Analysis of Optical Properties:**
   - Analyze the measured spectra to identify bandgaps, transmission peaks, and stop bands.
   - Compare experimental results with simulation data for validation.

### Data Analysis

1. **Graphical Representation:**
   - Plot the transmission and reflection spectra against wavelength.
   - Identify significant features, such as the photonic bandgap, and compare them with theoretical predictions.

2. **Calculate Quality Factors:**
   - Determine the quality factor (Q) for the measured resonances by analyzing the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peaks.
