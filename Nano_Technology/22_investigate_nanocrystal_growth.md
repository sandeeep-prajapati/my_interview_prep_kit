### Procedure:

#### Step 1: Synthesis of Nanocrystals

##### 1. Synthesis of Gold Nanocrystals (Au):
1. **Preparation of Solutions:**
   - Dissolve 0.5 g of gold(III) chloride in 50 mL of distilled water to prepare the gold precursor solution.
   - In a separate container, prepare a reducing solution by dissolving 0.19 g of sodium borohydride in 10 mL of distilled water.

2. **Reaction:**
   - While stirring the gold precursor solution, add the reducing agent solution dropwise at room temperature. The color of the solution will change from yellow to deep red, indicating the formation of gold nanocrystals.

3. **Stabilization:**
   - Add a stabilizing agent (e.g., PVP) to the reaction mixture to prevent aggregation.

4. **Purification:**
   - Centrifuge the mixture at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in distilled water for further analysis.

##### 2. Synthesis of Silver Nanocrystals (Ag):
1. **Preparation of Solutions:**
   - Dissolve 0.5 g of silver nitrate in 50 mL of distilled water.

2. **Reaction:**
   - Prepare a reducing solution using 0.5 g of ascorbic acid dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water.
   - Add the reducing solution to the silver nitrate solution while stirring, and observe the color change from colorless to yellowish-brown, indicating silver nanocrystal formation.

3. **Stabilization and Purification:**
   - Add PVA as a stabilizing agent and centrifuge the solution to collect the silver nanoparticles.

##### 3. Synthesis of Copper Nanocrystals (Cu):
1. **Preparation of Solutions:**
   - Dissolve 0.5 g of copper(II) sulfate in 50 mL of distilled water.

2. **Reaction:**
   - Use sodium borohydride as the reducing agent by preparing a solution similar to the previous methods.
   - Add the reducing agent dropwise to the copper sulfate solution while stirring to form copper nanocrystals.

3. **Stabilization and Purification:**
   - Add stabilizing agents and centrifuge the solution to isolate the nanoparticles.

#### Step 2: Characterization of Nanocrystals

1. **Morphological Analysis:**
   - Use SEM or TEM to characterize the size and shape of the synthesized nanocrystals.

2. **Optical Analysis:**
   - Use UV-Vis spectroscopy to analyze the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks for gold and silver nanoparticles, which provide insight into their size and shape.

3. **Size Distribution:**
   - Analyze particle size distribution using dynamic light scattering (DLS) if possible.

---

#### Step 3: Analysis of Growth Mechanisms

1. **Mechanism Investigation:**
   - Analyze how varying the concentration of metal precursor, reducing agent, and stabilizing agent affects the size and morphology of the synthesized nanocrystals.
   - Consider the following parameters:
     - **Supersaturation:** Higher supersaturation generally leads to faster nucleation and smaller particle size.
     - **Nucleation Rate:** A higher nucleation rate can be induced by rapid reduction or high concentration of precursor.
     - **Growth Rate:** After nucleation, the growth of nanocrystals is influenced by the availability of precursors and their deposition on existing particles.

2. **Kinetic Studies:**
   - Monitor the reaction over time to observe the growth of nanoparticles. Samples can be taken at regular intervals and characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy.

3. **Theoretical Models:**
   - Discuss theoretical models (e.g., LaMer model, Ostwald ripening) that describe the growth mechanisms observed during the experiments.

### Results Presentation

1. **Graphical Representation:**
   - Present the UV-Vis spectra showing the SPR peaks for the nanocrystals.
   - Include SEM/TEM images illustrating the morphology and size distribution of the nanocrystals.

2. **Discussion:**
