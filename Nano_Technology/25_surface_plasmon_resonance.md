### Experimental Procedure:

#### Step 1: Synthesis of Metallic Nanoparticles
1. **Synthesis:**
   - Synthesize gold or silver nanoparticles using a chemical reduction method (e.g., citrate reduction). 
   - For example, to synthesize gold nanoparticles:
     - Heat a solution of HAuClâ‚„ (gold chloride) in water.
     - Add sodium citrate solution while stirring to reduce gold ions to nanoparticles.
     - Maintain the reaction for 15-30 minutes until the solution turns a deep red color.

2. **Characterization:**
   - Use TEM to analyze the size and morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles. This step is crucial as the size of nanoparticles significantly affects their SPR properties.

#### Step 2: Preparation of Nanoparticle Film
1. **Dispersion:**
   - Dilute the synthesized nanoparticles in an appropriate solvent (e.g., ethanol) to obtain a suitable concentration.

2. **Deposition:**
   - If needed, use a spin coater to create a uniform thin film of nanoparticles on glass or silicon substrates. Spin coat at a moderate speed to achieve a desired thickness.

#### Step 3: UV-Vis Spectroscopy for SPR Analysis
1. **Sample Measurement:**
   - Place the nanoparticle film or dispersed nanoparticles in a quartz cuvette and measure the absorption spectrum using the UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
   - Record the absorption spectra in the range of 400 to 800 nm, as SPR typically occurs within this range for gold and silver nanoparticles.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze the peaks in the absorption spectrum corresponding to the SPR wavelength. The position and intensity of the peak can provide insights into the size, shape, and concentration of the nanoparticles.

#### Step 4: Application in Sensing
1. **Functionalization:**
   - Functionalize the surface of the nanoparticles with specific receptors (e.g., antibodies or molecular probes) that will selectively bind to the analyte of interest (e.g., glucose, proteins).
   - This step may involve incubation of the nanoparticles with the functionalizing agent followed by washing to remove unbound molecules.

2. **Sensing Experiment:**
   - Prepare a series of solutions with varying concentrations of the target analyte.
   - Measure the absorption spectra of the functionalized nanoparticle film or suspension before and after exposure to the analyte solutions.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze the shifts in the SPR peak wavelength or changes in absorption intensity in response to the analyte concentration. 
   - Construct a calibration curve to quantify the relationship between the analyte concentration and the observed SPR changes.

### Results and Discussion:

- **SPR Characteristics:**
  - Discuss the observed SPR peaks in relation to the size and morphology of the nanoparticles. Smaller nanoparticles may exhibit a blue shift, while larger particles may show a red shift.

- **Sensing Application:**
  - Evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the nanoparticle-based sensor based on the changes in SPR upon binding of the analyte. Discuss the potential for practical applications in biomedical sensing, environmental monitoring, or food safety.
