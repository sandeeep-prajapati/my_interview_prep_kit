Deploying a Laravel 11 project using GitHub Actions along with Bash and Batch scripting can streamline your workflow by automating the deployment process whenever you push changes to your repository. Below are detailed notes on how to set this up effectively.

---

### 1. **Prerequisites**

- A Laravel 11 application hosted on a server (VPS or cloud instance).
- Access to the server via SSH.
- A GitHub repository for your Laravel project.
- Installed Git and Composer on your server.

### 2. **Setting Up GitHub Actions**

1. **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow File**:
   - In your GitHub repository, navigate to `.github/workflows/`.
   - Create a new file, e.g., `deploy.yml`.

```yaml
name: Deploy Laravel Application

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Change this to your default branch if it's different

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up PHP
        uses: shivammathur/php-action@v2
        with:
          php-version: '8.0'  # Specify your PHP version
          extensions: mbstring, xml, curl, openssl, pdo, mysql

      - name: Install Composer Dependencies
        run: composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

      - name: Copy Files to Server
        env:
          SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}  # Add your SSH key in GitHub Secrets
          SERVER_IP: ${{ secrets.SERVER_IP }}  # Add your server IP in GitHub Secrets
          USERNAME: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}  # Add your server username in GitHub Secrets
        run: |
          echo "$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" > id_rsa
          chmod 600 id_rsa
          scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i id_rsa -r ./* $USERNAME@$SERVER_IP:/path/to/your/project

      - name: SSH into Server and Run Deployment Script
        run: |
          ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i id_rsa $USERNAME@$SERVER_IP 'bash -s' < ./deploy.sh  # Run the deployment script
```

### 3. **Create the Deployment Script (deploy.sh)**

Create a `deploy.sh` file in the root of your project repository. This script will handle the deployment steps on your server.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Exit on error
set -e

# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Pull the latest code (optional if using SCP)
# git pull origin main

# Install Composer dependencies
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

# Run database migrations
php artisan migrate --force

# Clear caches
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache

# Set permissions (if needed)
chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache
chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache

# Restart the queue worker if using queues
# php artisan queue:restart

# Optional: Restart your web server (Nginx/Apache)
# sudo service nginx restart
# sudo service apache2 restart
```

### 4. **Set Up Secrets in GitHub**

Go to your GitHub repository settings and set the following secrets:

- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your private SSH key for accessing the server.
- `SERVER_IP`: The IP address of your server.
- `USERNAME`: Your SSH username on the server.

### 5. **Using Batch Scripting (For Windows Server Deployment)**

If you are deploying to a Windows server, you can create a `deploy.bat` file instead of a `deploy.sh` file.

```batch
@echo off
SETLOCAL

:: Navigate to the project directory
cd C:\path\to\your\project

:: Pull the latest code (optional)
:: git pull origin main

:: Install Composer dependencies
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

:: Run database migrations
php artisan migrate --force

:: Clear caches
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache

:: Set permissions (if needed)
icacls storage /grant "IIS_IUSRS:(OI)(CI)F" /T
icacls bootstrap/cache /grant "IIS_IUSRS:(OI)(CI)F" /T

:: Restart IIS (optional)
:: iisreset

ENDLOCAL
```

### 6. **Testing the Workflow**

- Make a change to your codebase and push it to the main branch. 
- Go to the “Actions” tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the progress of the deployment.
- Ensure there are no errors in the workflow, and check your server to verify the deployment was successful.

### 7. **Handling Common Issues**

- **SSH Connection Issues**: Ensure your server allows SSH connections and that the IP is whitelisted.
- **Permissions Errors**: Adjust file permissions on your server as needed.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure your `.env` file is properly configured on the server.

### Summary

- **GitHub Actions**: Automate the deployment process with a CI/CD pipeline.
- **Bash/Bat Scripting**: Use scripts to streamline the deployment steps on the server.
- **Secrets Management**: Securely manage your server credentials using GitHub Secrets.

By following these steps, you can successfully set up a deployment pipeline for your Laravel 11 application using GitHub Actions, Bash, and Batch scripting. If you have further questions or need assistance with any specific part, feel free to ask!
