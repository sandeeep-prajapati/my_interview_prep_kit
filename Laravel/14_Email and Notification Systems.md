### Laravel 11: Email and Notification Systems

Laravel provides robust features for sending emails and notifications to users. It offers various ways to customize your email messages and notifications, making it easier to keep users informed and engaged.

---

### 1. **Setting Up Email Configuration**

Before sending emails, you need to configure your email settings in the `.env` file. Here’s an example configuration for using SMTP:

```plaintext
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@example.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

### 2. **Sending Emails**

To send emails, Laravel provides the `Mail` facade. You can create Mailable classes that represent the email content.

#### 2.1. **Creating a Mailable Class**

You can create a Mailable class using Artisan:

```bash
php artisan make:mail OrderShipped
```

#### 2.2. **Defining the Mailable**

In your newly created Mailable class (e.g., `OrderShipped.php`), you can define the email content:

```php
namespace App\Mail;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailable;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class OrderShipped extends Mailable
{
    use Queueable, SerializesModels;

    public $order;

    public function __construct($order)
    {
        $this->order = $order;
    }

    public function build()
    {
        return $this->subject('Your Order Has Shipped!')
                    ->view('emails.orders.shipped');
    }
}
```

#### 2.3. **Creating Email Views**

Create a Blade view for the email in `resources/views/emails/orders/shipped.blade.php`:

```blade
<h1>Order #{{ $order->id }} Shipped!</h1>
<p>Your order has been shipped and is on its way to you!</p>
```

#### 2.4. **Sending the Email**

You can send the email from a controller or any other class using:

```php
use App\Mail\OrderShipped;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

public function sendOrderConfirmation($order)
{
    Mail::to('user@example.com')->send(new OrderShipped($order));
}
```

---

### 3. **Queueing Emails**

For performance reasons, especially when sending emails in bulk, you can queue the email jobs:

```php
Mail::to('user@example.com')->queue(new OrderShipped($order));
```

Ensure you have set up your queue configuration and run the queue worker:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

---

### 4. **Notifications**

Laravel also provides a notification system that allows you to send notifications via various channels, including email, SMS, and Slack.

#### 4.1. **Creating a Notification Class**

You can create a notification class using Artisan:

```bash
php artisan make:notification InvoicePaid
```

#### 4.2. **Defining the Notification**

In your newly created notification class (e.g., `InvoicePaid.php`), you can define how the notification is delivered:

```php
namespace App\Notifications;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\MailMessage;

class InvoicePaid extends Notification
{
    use Queueable;

    public $invoice;

    public function __construct($invoice)
    {
        $this->invoice = $invoice;
    }

    public function via($notifiable)
    {
        return ['mail']; // Channels: 'mail', 'database', 'broadcast', etc.
    }

    public function toMail($notifiable)
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->subject('Your Invoice Has Been Paid!')
                    ->line('Your invoice for the amount of ' . $this->invoice->amount . ' has been paid.')
                    ->action('View Invoice', url('/invoices/' . $this->invoice->id))
                    ->line('Thank you for your business!');
    }
}
```

#### 4.3. **Sending Notifications**

You can send notifications from a controller or any other class using:

```php
use App\Notifications\InvoicePaid;

public function sendInvoiceNotification($invoice)
{
    $user = User::find(1);
    $user->notify(new InvoicePaid($invoice));
}
```

### 5. **Broadcasting Notifications**

You can also broadcast notifications in real-time using WebSockets. This requires additional setup with Laravel Echo and a broadcasting driver like Pusher or Redis.

#### 5.1. **Broadcasting Configuration**

You can specify the channels to broadcast notifications:

```php
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;

public function broadcastOn()
{
    return new Channel('user.' . $this->user->id);
}
```

### 6. **Database Notifications**

You can also store notifications in the database for later retrieval. Laravel provides a built-in database notification channel.

#### 6.1. **Creating Notifications Table**

Run the migration to create the notifications table:

```bash
php artisan notifications:table
php artisan migrate
```

#### 6.2. **Storing Notifications**

When using the `database` channel in your notification, it will automatically be stored in the database:

```php
public function via($notifiable)
{
    return ['database', 'mail'];
}
```

### 7. **Retrieving Notifications**

You can retrieve a user's notifications using:

```php
$notifications = Auth::user()->notifications;
```
