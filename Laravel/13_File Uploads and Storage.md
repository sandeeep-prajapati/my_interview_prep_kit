### Laravel 11: File Uploads and Storage

Laravel provides a simple and elegant way to handle file uploads and storage. This includes features for validating file uploads, storing files on various filesystems, and retrieving them when necessary.

---

### 1. **Setting Up File Uploads**

Before you start uploading files, ensure you have the following in your environment:

- **File System Configuration**: In `config/filesystems.php`, you can configure different disk options such as `local`, `public`, and cloud storage like Amazon S3.

### 2. **File Upload Form**

To upload files, you'll need an HTML form. Here’s a basic example:

```html
<form action="{{ route('upload') }}" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    @csrf
    <input type="file" name="file" required>
    <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

### 3. **Handling File Uploads in Controller**

In your controller, you can handle the file upload logic. Here's an example:

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

public function upload(Request $request)
{
    // Validate the uploaded file
    $request->validate([
        'file' => 'required|file|mimes:jpg,png,pdf|max:2048', // Max size 2MB
    ]);

    // Store the file
    $path = $request->file('file')->store('uploads'); // Stores in storage/app/uploads

    // Return the path or perform further operations
    return response()->json(['path' => $path]);
}
```

### 4. **Storing Files**

Laravel uses the `Storage` facade for file operations. You can store files in different disks based on your configuration.

#### 4.1. **Basic File Storage**

```php
$path = $request->file('file')->store('uploads'); // Default disk (local)
```

#### 4.2. **Storing with a Custom Filename**

```php
$path = $request->file('file')->storeAs('uploads', 'custom_filename.jpg');
```

#### 4.3. **Storing in Public Disk**

To make the files publicly accessible, you can use the `storePublicly` method:

```php
$path = $request->file('file')->storePublicly('uploads', 'public');
```

### 5. **Retrieving Files**

To retrieve uploaded files, you can use the `Storage` facade.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;

// Get the file URL for public access
$url = Storage::url($path); // Generates a URL to access the file
```

### 6. **File Deletion**

You can delete files using the `delete` method on the `Storage` facade:

```php
Storage::delete($path);
```

### 7. **File Storage Configuration**

You can configure your storage settings in `config/filesystems.php`. Here’s a basic overview of available disks:

- **Local**: Default disk for local storage (storage/app).
- **Public**: Disk for publicly accessible files (storage/app/public).
- **S3**: Configuration for Amazon S3 storage.
- **Other Cloud Services**: You can also configure other cloud storage providers.

### 8. **Linking Public Storage**

To make files stored in the `public` disk accessible from the web, you need to create a symbolic link:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

This command creates a symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public`, allowing you to access files through URLs.

### 9. **File Upload Validation**

When uploading files, you should always validate the file type and size to ensure data integrity and security. Laravel provides built-in validation rules for file uploads:

- `required`: Ensures the file is uploaded.
- `file`: Ensures the uploaded item is a file.
- `mimes:jpg,png,pdf`: Restricts the file types.
- `max:2048`: Limits the file size (in kilobytes).

### 10. **Handling Large File Uploads**

For larger files, you may need to increase the upload limits in your PHP configuration (`php.ini`):

```ini
upload_max_filesize = 10M
post_max_size = 10M
```

### Summary

- **File Uploads**: Use forms with `enctype="multipart/form-data"` to upload files.
- **Storage**: Use the `Storage` facade to handle file storage, retrieval, and deletion.
- **Validation**: Always validate uploaded files for type and size.
- **Public Access**: Use symbolic links to make uploaded files accessible via URLs.
