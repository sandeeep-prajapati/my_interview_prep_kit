Setting up an Express.js application involves a few straightforward steps. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to install and set up an Express.js application.

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Before you can use Express.js, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). The installer includes npm (Node Package Manager), which you'll need for managing packages.

### Step 2: Create a New Project Directory

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
2. **Create a new directory for your project** (replace `my-express-app` with your desired project name):

   ```bash
   mkdir my-express-app
   cd my-express-app
   ```

### Step 3: Initialize a New Node.js Project

Run the following command to create a `package.json` file, which will hold metadata about your project and its dependencies:

```bash
npm init -y
```

The `-y` flag automatically answers "yes" to all prompts, using default values.

### Step 4: Install Express.js

To install Express.js, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install express
```

This command adds Express as a dependency in your project and updates the `package.json` file.

### Step 5: Create a Basic Express.js Application

1. **Create a new file named `app.js`** in your project directory:

   ```bash
   touch app.js
   ```

   If you're on Windows, you can create the file using:

   ```bash
   echo. > app.js
   ```

2. **Open `app.js` in your text editor** and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   // Import the Express module
   const express = require('express');

   // Create an Express application
   const app = express();

   // Define a route for the root URL
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello, Express.js!');
   });

   // Start the server and listen on a port
   const PORT = 3000;
   app.listen(PORT, () => {
       console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

### Step 6: Run the Application

1. **In the terminal, run the application using Node.js:**

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

2. **Open your web browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the message "Hello, Express.js!" displayed on the page.

### Step 7: Additional Configuration (Optional)

- **Install Development Tools**: You may want to install additional tools to enhance your development experience. A popular option is `nodemon`, which automatically restarts your server when you make changes:

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev nodemon
  ```

  You can then run your application with:

  ```bash
  npx nodemon app.js
  ```

- **Setup a Git Repository**: If you want to version control your application, initialize a git repository:

  ```bash
  git init
  ```

### Conclusion

You have now installed and set up a basic Express.js application! From here, you can expand your application by adding routes, middleware, and integrating with databases or other services as needed. Express.js is highly extensible, allowing for a wide range of functionalities to be added easily.
