# 7. **Data Loading with `DataLoader`**

## Working with `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and `DataLoader` for Batch Processing and Dataset Management

Efficient data loading and management is crucial for training deep learning models, especially when working with large datasets. PyTorch provides powerful utilities such as `Dataset` and `DataLoader` to simplify the process of handling, shuffling, and batching data.

### 7.1 **`torch.utils.data.Dataset`**

- **Dataset** is an abstract class representing a dataset. You can create custom datasets by subclassing `Dataset` and implementing two key methods:
  - `__len__`: Returns the size of the dataset.
  - `__getitem__`: Retrieves a sample from the dataset at a given index.

- **Example of a Custom Dataset**:
  ```python
  from torch.utils.data import Dataset

  class CustomDataset(Dataset):
      def __init__(self, data, labels):
          self.data = data
          self.labels = labels

      def __len__(self):
          return len(self.data)

      def __getitem__(self, idx):
          sample = self.data[idx]
          label = self.labels[idx]
          return sample, label
  ```

- **Use Case**: You can use this for datasets that are not directly available in PyTorch, such as custom CSV, JSON, or image datasets. 

### 7.2 **`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`**

- **DataLoader** is a utility to load data from a `Dataset` and perform batching, shuffling, and multi-process data loading. It simplifies the process of iterating over datasets efficiently, especially for large datasets that can't fit in memory all at once.

- **Key Parameters**:
  - `dataset`: The dataset from which to load the data.
  - `batch_size`: The number of samples per batch.
  - `shuffle`: Whether to shuffle the data at the start of each epoch.
  - `num_workers`: Number of worker processes used to load data in parallel.

- **Example of Using `DataLoader`**:
  ```python
  from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

  dataset = CustomDataset(data, labels)
  dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True, num_workers=4)

  for batch_data, batch_labels in dataloader:
      # Train the model on batch_data and batch_labels
      pass
  ```

- **Use Case**: Ideal for efficiently managing data in batches during the training and validation process, ensuring that each batch is loaded and processed in parallel for faster training.

### 7.3 **Batch Processing**

- **Batching** allows you to feed multiple samples to the model at once, rather than one at a time. This increases training efficiency, especially when using GPUs.
  
- **Advantages of Batch Processing**:
  - Reduces the number of updates, which can speed up training.
  - Helps to smooth out the gradients over multiple samples, which can lead to more stable convergence.

### 7.4 **Shuffling and Parallel Data Loading**

- **Shuffling**: Randomizes the data order at the start of each epoch to prevent the model from learning the order of the data. This is particularly important for training robust models.

- **Parallel Data Loading**: By setting `num_workers > 0`, data is loaded in parallel, which can significantly speed up training, especially for I/O-bound tasks such as loading images from disk.

### 7.5 **Working with Built-in Datasets**

PyTorch provides several built-in datasets like **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **ImageNet**, which can be easily used with `DataLoader`.

- **Example of Loading MNIST Dataset**:
  ```python
  from torchvision import datasets, transforms

  transform = transforms.Compose([
      transforms.ToTensor(),
      transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))
  ])

  mnist_train = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
  train_loader = DataLoader(mnist_train, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

  for images, labels in train_loader:
      # Training loop
      pass
  ```

### 7.6 **Custom Transformations**

- You can use the `transforms` module from `torchvision` to apply transformations such as normalization, data augmentation, and resizing.
  
- **Example of Applying Transformations**:
  ```python
  from torchvision import transforms

  transform = transforms.Compose([
      transforms.Resize((128, 128)),
      transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
      transforms.ToTensor()
  ])

  dataset = datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
  ```
