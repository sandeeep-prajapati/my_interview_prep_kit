### **Presentational Components**: Notes

**Presentational Components** (also known as **Dumb Components** or **Stateless Components**) are a fundamental concept in React used to separate concerns between UI presentation and application logic.

These components focus purely on the **UI rendering** aspect without managing state or handling logic. Instead, they receive data and functions as props and return JSX that defines the visual structure of the UI.

---

### **Key Characteristics of Presentational Components**:

1. **No State**: Presentational components do not manage their own state. They receive any necessary data via props.
  
2. **Props-Driven**: The only data or functions they use are passed down from a parent component through **props**.

3. **Focused on UI**: Their sole responsibility is to render the **UI** based on the props provided.

4. **Reusable and Easy to Test**: Since they don't handle complex logic, they are highly **reusable** and easy to test, as they rely purely on their input (props) and output (JSX).

5. **Stateless**: Typically, presentational components are **functional components**, as they do not require React's class lifecycle methods or state management.

---

### **Example of a Presentational Component:**

#### **Functional Component Example**:
```jsx
function Button({ label, onClick }) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
}
```
- This button component does not manage its own state or logic. It simply takes `label` and `onClick` as props and renders a button with a click handler.

#### **Class Component Example**:
Although class components are not typically used for presentational purposes, they can still be used without managing state.
```jsx
class Button extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { label, onClick } = this.props;
    return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
  }
}
```

### **When to Use Presentational Components**:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: If you want to **separate the UI** from the logic, use presentational components to handle the display, and let **container components** handle the state and logic.

2. **Reusable UI Elements**: Use presentational components to create reusable UI elements like buttons, forms, or layout elements that are independent of the application logic.

3. **Easier Maintenance**: By keeping the UI rendering separate, presentational components are easier to maintain and refactor since they don't depend on the application state or logic.

### **Presentational vs. Container Components**:

| **Aspect**                | **Presentational Components**                    | **Container Components**                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                | Focus on UI rendering                            | Handle application logic, state management, and data fetching  |
| **State**                  | Stateless (uses props)                           | Stateful (manages its own state or passes state down as props) |
| **Logic**                  | No logic (except UI-related tasks)               | Contains business logic and handles side effects               |
| **Props**                  | Receives data and callbacks from container       | Passes data and callbacks to presentational components         |
| **Reusability**            | Highly reusable across different parts of the app| Less reusable due to specific logic                            |

### **Example: Using Presentational Components with Container Components**:

#### **Container Component**:
The container component handles state and passes it to the presentational component as props.
```jsx
class ButtonContainer extends React.Component {
  state = { clicked: false };

  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState({ clicked: !this.state.clicked });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Button 
        label={this.state.clicked ? 'Clicked' : 'Click Me'}
        onClick={this.handleClick}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

#### **Presentational Component**:
```jsx
function Button({ label, onClick }) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
}
```
- In this example, the `ButtonContainer` handles the click logic and state, while the `Button` presentational component focuses on rendering the button UI.

---

### **Advantages of Presentational Components**:

1. **Separation of UI and Logic**: Encourages clear separation between how the UI looks and how it behaves.
   
2. **Reusability**: Presentational components can be reused throughout the application in various contexts without modification.

3. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain as UI and logic are clearly separated into different components.

4. **Simpler Testing**: Since presentational components only deal with UI, they can be easily tested with mock props and snapshots.

5. **Better Collaboration**: Designers can focus on presentational components without worrying about logic, while developers can handle the container components with state and logic.

---

### **When to Avoid Presentational Components**:

- If a component needs to manage its own state, handle complex business logic, or perform data fetching, it should be a **container component**, not purely presentational.

---

### **Conclusion**:
Presentational components play a crucial role in **React's component architecture** by focusing solely on rendering UI, leading to more organized, reusable, and maintainable code. They are often used in conjunction with **container components**, which handle the state and logic, to create a clean separation of concerns.
