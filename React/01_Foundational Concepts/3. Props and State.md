Here are notes on **Props and State** in React:

---

### 1. **Props (Properties)**

**Definition**:  
Props are short for "properties" and are used to pass data from one component to another in React. They are **read-only** and cannot be modified by the receiving component. Props are used to make components dynamic and reusable by allowing them to accept dynamic data.

**Key Points**:
- **Immutable**: Props cannot be changed by the child component that receives them. They are passed from parent to child components.
- **Passed from Parent to Child**: Props allow the passing of data and event handlers from parent components to child components.
- **Reusable Components**: Props allow components to be reused with different data.
  
**Usage Example**:
```jsx
function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <h1>{props.message}</h1>;
}

function ParentComponent() {
  return <ChildComponent message="Hello, World!" />;
}
```

In the above example, the `message` prop is passed from `ParentComponent` to `ChildComponent`.

**Functional vs Class Components**:
- In **functional components**, props are passed as function arguments.
- In **class components**, props are accessed via `this.props`.

### 2. **State**

**Definition**:  
State is a built-in object in React that allows components to maintain their own internal data. Unlike props, state is **mutable** and can change over time, typically as a response to user actions or system events.

**Key Points**:
- **Mutable**: Unlike props, state can be modified using `setState()` (in class components) or the `useState` hook (in functional components).
- **Controlled Internally**: Each component can manage its own state.
- **Triggers Re-renders**: When state changes, React triggers a re-render of the component to reflect the updated data.

**Usage Example (Class Component)**:
```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

**Usage Example (Functional Component)**:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the functional component example, the `useState` hook is used to manage the state.

### 3. **Differences Between Props and State**

| **Props**                               | **State**                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Passed from parent to child components  | Managed internally by the component |
| Immutable (cannot be changed)           | Mutable (can be updated)            |
| Used for component configuration        | Used for dynamic, changing data     |
| Doesn't trigger re-render on change     | Triggers re-render when updated     |

### 4. **Best Practices**:
- Use **props** when data needs to be passed from parent to child components.
- Use **state** to manage data that changes over time or in response to user input or other actions.
