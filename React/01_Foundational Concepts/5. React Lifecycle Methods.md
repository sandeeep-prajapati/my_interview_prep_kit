In React, lifecycle methods refer to the stages in a class-based component's life from when it is created to when it is removed from the DOM. These methods provide hooks that allow developers to execute code at specific points in a component's lifecycle.

Lifecycle methods can be grouped into three main phases:

### 1. **Mounting Phase**  
This phase occurs when a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.

- **constructor(props)**  
  This is called before the component is mounted. It is used to initialize the component’s state and bind methods to `this`.  
  ```js
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }
  ```

- **static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)**  
  This is rarely used and allows the component to update its state in response to changes in props.  
  ```js
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState) {
    // Return new state based on changes in props
  }
  ```

- **render()**  
  This is the only required lifecycle method in class components. It returns the JSX that defines the UI.
  ```js
  render() {
    return <div>My Component</div>;
  }
  ```

- **componentDidMount()**  
  This is called after the component has been rendered in the DOM. It is commonly used to make network requests, initialize timers, or perform other side effects.
  ```js
  componentDidMount() {
    // Ideal for making API calls or setting up subscriptions
    fetchData();
  }
  ```

### 2. **Updating Phase**  
This phase occurs when the component’s state or props are updated. The component is re-rendered when an update occurs.

- **static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)**  
  As mentioned before, this method runs during both the mounting and updating phases, allowing the component to update its state in response to prop changes.

- **shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)**  
  This method allows you to prevent unnecessary renders by returning `false` if the component doesn’t need to update. By default, it returns `true`.  
  ```js
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    return nextProps.value !== this.props.value; // Re-render only if value prop changes
  }
  ```

- **render()**  
  This is called again when a component updates. The UI is re-rendered based on the updated state or props.

- **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)**  
  This method captures information from the DOM before it updates. It is mostly used when handling scroll positions or similar tasks. The value returned from this method is passed as an argument to `componentDidUpdate`.  
  ```js
  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    return { scrollPosition: window.scrollY };
  }
  ```

- **componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)**  
  This method is called after the component updates. It is used to perform side effects, such as network requests or DOM updates. It can also access the snapshot returned by `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`.
  ```js
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {
    if (prevState.count !== this.state.count) {
      console.log('State has changed');
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. **Unmounting Phase**  
This phase occurs when a component is being removed from the DOM.

- **componentWillUnmount()**  
  This method is called right before the component is unmounted and destroyed. It is typically used to clean up any resources such as timers or network requests to prevent memory leaks.  
  ```js
  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Clean up event listeners, cancel network requests, or clear timers
    clearInterval(this.timer);
  }
  ```

### 4. **Error Handling Phase**  
These methods handle errors that occur in the component tree.

- **static getDerivedStateFromError(error)**  
  This method is used to update state when an error occurs during rendering, lifecycle methods, or in the constructor of any child component. It is part of the error boundary mechanism.
  ```js
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }
  ```

- **componentDidCatch(error, info)**  
  This method is called when an error occurs and can be used to log error details or perform custom error handling.
  ```js
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    console.error("Error caught: ", error, info);
  }
  ```

### Lifecycle Methods in Functional Components (Hooks)

With functional components, Hooks like `useEffect` replace many of the class-based lifecycle methods. Here’s how lifecycle methods map to Hooks:

- **componentDidMount** → `useEffect(() => { ... }, [])`
- **componentDidUpdate** → `useEffect(() => { ... }, [dependencies])`
- **componentWillUnmount** → `useEffect(() => { return () => { ... }; }, [])`

For example:
```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
    
    return () => {
      // Cleanup when component unmounts
      console.log('Component will unmount');
    };
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Summary
React lifecycle methods allow developers to handle component creation, updates, and unmounting in class-based components. Functional components, with the help of Hooks, can achieve similar functionality in a more concise way.
