In React, components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be categorized into **functional components** and **class-based components**.

### 1. **Functional Components**  
Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX (a syntax extension that looks like HTML) to describe what the UI should look like. They are simpler and easier to read than class components and have gained popularity, especially with the introduction of React Hooks.

**Syntax Example**:
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

**Key Features**:
- **Stateless**: Initially, functional components could not have state, but with the introduction of Hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`), they can now manage state.
- **Hooks**: Hooks allow functional components to have features like state and lifecycle methods, which were traditionally only available in class components.
- **Simpler and shorter syntax**: Functional components are written as simple functions, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

**Hooks Example**:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. **Class-based Components**  
Class-based components are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`. They have more complexity, as they require managing lifecycle methods and binding event handlers.

**Syntax Example**:
```jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

**Key Features**:
- **Stateful**: Class components can maintain and manipulate state through `this.state`.
- **Lifecycle methods**: Class components provide access to lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`, which are used to control the behavior of a component during different stages of its lifecycle.
- **Verbose**: Class components tend to have more boilerplate code, making them harder to maintain.

**Lifecycle Example**:
```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('Component did mount');
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log('Component did update');
  }

  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Key Differences:
- **Simplicity**: Functional components are simpler with less boilerplate, while class components are more verbose and complex.
- **State and Lifecycle**: Initially, only class components could have state and lifecycle methods, but with React Hooks, functional components now support both.
- **Performance**: Functional components are generally more performant because they don't rely on class inheritance and the `this` keyword.
  
**Current Trend**: Functional components, paired with Hooks, are now the standard in modern React development due to their simplicity and flexibility.
