### Notes on Stored Procedures in MySQL

Stored procedures are a set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed as a single unit. They encapsulate complex logic and operations, which can enhance code reusability, simplify database management, and improve performance by reducing the amount of data sent over the network.

#### 1. **What are Stored Procedures?**

- **Definition**: A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of SQL statements that can be executed as a single command.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Modularity**: Code can be organized into logical units.
  - **Reusability**: Procedures can be reused across applications.
  - **Performance**: Reduces the need to send multiple SQL statements over the network.
  - **Security**: Access can be controlled, allowing users to execute procedures without exposing underlying data structures.

#### 2. **Creating Stored Procedures**

You can create a stored procedure using the `CREATE PROCEDURE` statement. The syntax includes defining parameters, the procedure's body, and any relevant options.

**Basic Syntax**:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name ([parameters])
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements
END;
```

**Example**: Creating a simple stored procedure to get employee details.

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails(IN emp_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = emp_id;
END $$

DELIMITER ;
```

In this example:
- `GetEmployeeDetails` is the name of the stored procedure.
- It accepts one parameter, `emp_id`, of type `INT`.
- The body of the procedure contains a `SELECT` statement that retrieves employee details based on the provided `employee_id`.

---

#### 3. **Executing Stored Procedures**

To execute a stored procedure, use the `CALL` statement followed by the procedure name and any required parameters.

**Example**:

```sql
CALL GetEmployeeDetails(1);
```

In this example, the procedure `GetEmployeeDetails` is called with the parameter `1`, which retrieves the details of the employee with `employee_id` equal to `1`.

---

#### 4. **Modifying Stored Procedures**

If you need to change an existing stored procedure, you can use the `ALTER PROCEDURE` statement, or you can simply drop and recreate it.

**Example**: Altering a stored procedure by dropping it first.

```sql
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS GetEmployeeDetails;

DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails(IN emp_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT employee_name, department FROM employees WHERE employee_id = emp_id;
END $$

DELIMITER ;
```

---

#### 5. **Benefits of Using Parameters**

Stored procedures can accept parameters to make them more dynamic and reusable. Parameters can be defined as:
- **IN**: Input parameter, which is read-only.
- **OUT**: Output parameter, which is used to return values.
- **INOUT**: Both input and output, allowing the parameter to be modified.

**Example**: Using INOUT parameters.

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateEmployeeSalary(INOUT emp_id INT, IN new_salary DECIMAL(10,2))
BEGIN
    UPDATE employees SET salary = new_salary WHERE employee_id = emp_id;
END $$

DELIMITER ;
```

In this example, `emp_id` is an INOUT parameter that can be modified within the procedure.

---

#### 6. **Handling Errors in Stored Procedures**

You can include error handling in stored procedures using `DECLARE` statements to manage exceptions effectively.

**Example**: Error handling with DECLARE.

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE SafeUpdateEmployeeSalary(IN emp_id INT, IN new_salary DECIMAL(10,2))
BEGIN
    DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
    BEGIN
        -- Error handling logic
        ROLLBACK;
    END;

    START TRANSACTION;

    UPDATE employees SET salary = new_salary WHERE employee_id = emp_id;

    COMMIT;
END $$

DELIMITER ;
```

In this example, if an error occurs during the update operation, the transaction is rolled back, and the error handling logic is executed.

### Conclusion

Stored procedures are powerful tools in MySQL for encapsulating complex logic and managing database operations. They enhance modularity, reusability, and security while improving performance. By understanding how to create, execute, and manage stored procedures, you can leverage their full potential to create efficient and maintainable database applications.
