Here’s a guide to installing PyTorch across different platforms using Bash scripting.

---

### 1. **Check System Requirements**

- Confirm the operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux - WSL).
- Ensure Python and `pip` are installed. If not, the script can include commands to install them.
- Determine if CUDA is available for GPU support or if CPU-only installation is required.

---

### 2. **Write the Bash Script**

#### Structure of the Script

The script should:
1. Detect the operating system.
2. Confirm if CUDA is supported and which version to install.
3. Install PyTorch via `pip` for the appropriate platform and configuration.

#### Example Bash Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check for Python installation
if ! command -v python3 &> /dev/null
then
    echo "Python3 could not be found. Installing Python..."
    # Add installation command depending on OS
    # For Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 -y
    sudo apt install python3-pip -y
fi

# Check for pip installation
if ! command -v pip3 &> /dev/null
then
    echo "pip could not be found. Installing pip..."
    # For Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt install python3-pip -y
fi

# Determine CUDA or CPU-only installation
read -p "Do you have a CUDA-capable GPU? (y/n): " use_cuda

if [[ "$use_cuda" == "y" || "$use_cuda" == "Y" ]]; then
    echo "Please enter your CUDA version (e.g., 11.8): "
    read cuda_version
    echo "Installing PyTorch with CUDA $cuda_version support..."
    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu${cuda_version//.}/
else
    echo "Installing CPU-only PyTorch..."
    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
fi

# Verify Installation
if python3 -c "import torch" &> /dev/null; then
    echo "PyTorch successfully installed."
else
    echo "PyTorch installation failed."
fi
```

### 3. **Explanation of Script Components**

- **Platform Check**: The script checks if `python3` and `pip3` are installed. If not, it installs them.
- **CUDA Selection**: The user specifies if they want CUDA support, and if so, they input the CUDA version.
- **PyTorch Installation**:
  - If CUDA is chosen, the script installs PyTorch with the specified CUDA version.
  - Otherwise, it installs CPU-only PyTorch.
- **Verification**: Finally, it checks if PyTorch was installed by attempting to import it in Python.

### 4. **Run the Script**

To run the script:
1. Save it as `install_pytorch.sh`.
2. Give it executable permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x install_pytorch.sh
   ```

3. Execute it:

   ```bash
   ./install_pytorch.sh
   ```

### 5. **Testing & Troubleshooting**

1. **Version Conflicts**: Ensure the CUDA version installed is compatible with the GPU.
2. **OS Dependencies**: For systems like macOS, additional dependencies (e.g., `brew install python3`) may be needed.
3. **Error Handling**: Extend the script to handle errors, such as missing CUDA dependencies.

### Summary

This script provides an automated way to install PyTorch across Linux-based platforms and WSL, giving flexibility to install with or without GPU support based on the user's hardware configuration.
