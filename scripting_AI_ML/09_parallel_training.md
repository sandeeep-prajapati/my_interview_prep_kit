To launch parallel PyTorch training jobs across multiple machines with a Batch script, you’ll need a setup where each machine can be accessed remotely (using `ssh`) and has PyTorch installed along with the necessary dataset and scripts. This Batch script will initiate a training job on each specified remote machine in parallel.

Here’s a guide:

1. **Define Machines**: You’ll specify the IP addresses or hostnames of the machines in the script.
2. **Script to Train**: Assume you have a training script (`train_model.py`) on each remote machine or can copy it over before starting the job.

### Batch Script to Launch Parallel Jobs (`run_parallel_jobs.bat`)

This Batch script:
- Connects to each specified machine using `ssh`.
- Initiates the training job on each machine in the background, allowing them to run concurrently.
- Logs the output of each job to a separate log file for tracking.

**Prerequisites**:
- SSH access is configured for passwordless login to each machine, or you’re using a tool like `plink` (from PuTTY) for SSH access with credentials stored securely.

```batch
@echo off
setlocal

REM Define machines with IP addresses or hostnames
set "MACHINES=192.168.1.101 192.168.1.102 192.168.1.103"
set "SCRIPT_PATH=/path/to/train_model.py"
set "REMOTE_OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/output"
set "LOCAL_OUTPUT_DIR=%cd%\output_logs"
set "USERNAME=your_user"  REM Replace with your remote username

REM Create local output directory for logs
if not exist "%LOCAL_OUTPUT_DIR%" mkdir "%LOCAL_OUTPUT_DIR%"

REM Loop through each machine and launch the training job in parallel
for %%M in (%MACHINES%) do (
    echo Starting training job on %%M
    start "" cmd /c ^
        "ssh %USERNAME%@%%M "python3 %SCRIPT_PATH% > %REMOTE_OUTPUT_DIR%/output_%%M.log" ^&^& exit"
    echo Training job on %%M launched, logging to %LOCAL_OUTPUT_DIR%\output_%%M.log
)

REM Inform the user that jobs have been launched
echo All training jobs have been launched in parallel.
```

### Explanation of Key Components

1. **Machine List**: Define each machine’s IP address or hostname in `MACHINES`.
2. **Script Path**: Set `SCRIPT_PATH` to the path of the training script on the remote machine. If the script isn’t already present, you can use `scp` to copy it over before starting.
3. **Output Logging**:
   - `REMOTE_OUTPUT_DIR` specifies where each machine will store the training log.
   - `LOCAL_OUTPUT_DIR` specifies the local directory for organizing logs from each machine.
4. **Parallel Execution**:
   - The `start` command launches `ssh` commands in separate command windows, allowing parallel execution.
   - Each machine runs the `train_model.py` script in the background.

### Running the Script

1. Save the script as `run_parallel_jobs.bat`.
2. Modify `MACHINES`, `SCRIPT_PATH`, `REMOTE_OUTPUT_DIR`, and `USERNAME` as needed.
3. Execute the Batch script:

   ```cmd
   run_parallel_jobs.bat
   ```

### Notes

- Ensure each remote machine has the dataset, PyTorch, and any necessary dependencies pre-installed.
- Logs are saved in separate files for each machine in the `output_logs` directory for easy tracking and troubleshooting.
- If you don’t have passwordless SSH access, tools like `plink.exe` with an authentication key can replace `ssh`.
