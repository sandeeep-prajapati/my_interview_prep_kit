Quantum gates are the building blocks of quantum circuits, analogous to classical logic gates. In Qiskit, several common quantum gates manipulate the states of qubits. Hereâ€™s an overview of the most commonly used gates: **X**, **Y**, **Z**, **H**, and **CNOT**. 

### 1. X Gate (Pauli-X Gate)
- **Function**: The X gate, also known as the NOT gate or Pauli-X gate, flips the state of a qubit. If the qubit is in the state \(|0\rangle\), it will become \(|1\rangle\) and vice versa.
- **Matrix Representation**:
  \[
  X = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1 \\
  1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
- **Application**:
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

qc = QuantumCircuit(1)  # Create a circuit with 1 qubit
qc.x(0)                 # Apply the X gate to qubit 0
print(qc.draw())
```

### 2. Y Gate (Pauli-Y Gate)
- **Function**: The Y gate is another Pauli gate that flips the qubit and introduces a phase of \(\pi\) (180 degrees). It transforms \(|0\rangle\) to \(i|1\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) to \(-i|0\rangle\).
- **Matrix Representation**:
  \[
  Y = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & -i \\
  i & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
- **Application**:
```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)  # Create a circuit with 1 qubit
qc.y(0)                 # Apply the Y gate to qubit 0
print(qc.draw())
```

### 3. Z Gate (Pauli-Z Gate)
- **Function**: The Z gate introduces a phase flip to the qubit. It leaves \(|0\rangle\) unchanged but flips the phase of \(|1\rangle\).
- **Matrix Representation**:
  \[
  Z = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 \\
  0 & -1
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
- **Application**:
```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)  # Create a circuit with 1 qubit
qc.z(0)                 # Apply the Z gate to qubit 0
print(qc.draw())
```

### 4. H Gate (Hadamard Gate)
- **Function**: The Hadamard gate creates superposition. It transforms \(|0\rangle\) into \(|+\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) into \(|-\rangle\).
- **Matrix Representation**:
  \[
  H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 1 \\
  1 & -1
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
- **Application**:
```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)  # Create a circuit with 1 qubit
qc.h(0)                 # Apply the H gate to qubit 0
print(qc.draw())
```

### 5. CNOT Gate (Controlled-NOT Gate)
- **Function**: The CNOT gate is a two-qubit gate that flips the state of the target qubit if the control qubit is \(|1\rangle\). It creates entanglement between qubits.
- **Matrix Representation**:
  \[
  \text{CNOT} = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
- **Application**:
```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)  # Create a circuit with 2 qubits
qc.cx(0, 1)             # Apply the CNOT gate (0 is control, 1 is target)
print(qc.draw())
```

### Summary
Here's a recap of the common quantum gates:

| Gate | Symbol | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| X    | \(X\)  | Flips the state of a qubit (NOT gate). |
| Y    | \(Y\)  | Flips the state and introduces a phase of \(\pi\). |
| Z    | \(Z\)  | Flips the phase of \(|1\rangle\). |
| H    | \(H\)  | Creates superposition from a basis state. |
| CNOT | \(CX\) | Flips the target qubit if the control qubit is \(|1\rangle\). |

These gates can be combined to form complex quantum circuits that enable quantum algorithms to leverage superposition and entanglement, fundamentally differentiating them from classical computation.
