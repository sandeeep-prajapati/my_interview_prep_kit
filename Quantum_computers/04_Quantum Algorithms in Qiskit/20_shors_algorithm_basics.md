### **What is Shor's Algorithm?**

Shor's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization, crucial for breaking widely-used cryptographic systems like RSA. It efficiently factors a composite number \( N \) in polynomial time by finding the period of a specific function, leveraging quantum mechanics to outperform classical algorithms.

---

### **Key Steps in Shor’s Algorithm**

1. **Choose a Random Integer \( a \)**:
   Select \( a \) such that \( 1 < a < N \) and \( \text{gcd}(a, N) = 1 \). If \( \text{gcd}(a, N) > 1 \), \( a \) is a factor.

2. **Find the Period \( r \)**:
   Using a quantum circuit, determine the period \( r \) of the modular function:
   \[
   f(x) = a^x \mod N
   \]
   where \( f(x + r) = f(x) \).

3. **Classical Computation**:
   Use \( r \) to find factors:
   - If \( r \) is even, compute \( x = a^{r/2} \mod N \).
   - If \( x \neq \pm1 \mod N \), then \( \text{gcd}(x - 1, N) \) or \( \text{gcd}(x + 1, N) \) gives a factor of \( N \).

4. **Repeat if Necessary**:
   If the factors are trivial, repeat with a different \( a \).

### **Simplified Implementation of Shor’s Algorithm in Qiskit**

For demonstration, we use a small composite number \( N = 15 \) and a base \( a = 7 \).

---

#### **Quantum Period-Finding in Qiskit**

The quantum circuit finds the period \( r \) of \( f(x) = 7^x \mod 15 \).

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.circuit.library import QFT
from math import gcd
import numpy as np

# Function to implement controlled multiplication mod N
def c_amod15(a, n):
    """Controlled multiplication by a mod 15."""
    qc = QuantumCircuit(4)
    for _ in range(a % 15):
        qc.swap(2, 3)
        qc.cx(1, 2)
        qc.swap(2, 3)
    qc = qc.to_gate()
    qc.name = f"{a} mod 15"
    return qc.control()

# Parameters
N = 15  # Number to factor
a = 7   # Random integer

# Quantum Circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(8, 4)

# Step 1: Apply Hadamard gates to the counting qubits
qc.h(range(4))

# Step 2: Add controlled-U gates for f(x) = 7^x mod 15
for i in range(4):
    qc.append(c_amod15(2**i, 15), [i] + list(range(4, 8)))

# Step 3: Apply the inverse QFT to the counting qubits
qc.append(QFT(4, inverse=True).to_gate(), range(4))

# Step 4: Measure the counting qubits
qc.measure(range(4), range(4))

# Draw the circuit
qc.draw('mpl')
```

---

#### **Simulate the Circuit**

```python
# Simulate the circuit
simulator = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator')
result = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1024).result()
counts = result.get_counts()

# Plot the results
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
plot_histogram(counts)
```

### **Classical Post-Processing**

1. **Interpret the Measurement**:
   The output corresponds to \( \frac{s}{r} \) (a fraction) in binary. Use continued fractions to approximate \( r \).

2. **Find Factors**:
   Using the period \( r \), compute \( x = a^{r/2} \mod N \) and the factors \( \text{gcd}(x-1, N) \) and \( \text{gcd}(x+1, N) \).

---

### **Significance of Simplified Implementation**

- Demonstrates the **quantum period-finding** subroutine of Shor’s algorithm.
- Highlights the interplay between quantum and classical computation in solving real-world problems.

### **Challenges in Real-World Implementation**

1. **Scalability**: Requires many qubits and high gate fidelity for large \( N \).
2. **Error Correction**: Noise in quantum hardware can affect results.

Despite challenges, Shor's algorithm remains a cornerstone of quantum computing, showcasing its potential to disrupt classical cryptography.
