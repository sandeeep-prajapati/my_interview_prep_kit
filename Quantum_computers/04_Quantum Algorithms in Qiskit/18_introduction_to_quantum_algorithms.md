### **What are Quantum Algorithms?**

Quantum algorithms are computational procedures that leverage the principles of **quantum mechanics**—such as **superposition**, **entanglement**, and **interference**—to solve problems more efficiently than classical algorithms. 

Notable examples of quantum algorithms include:
- **Shor’s Algorithm**: Efficiently factors integers, breaking RSA encryption.
- **Grover’s Algorithm**: Performs unstructured search with quadratic speedup.
- **Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)**: Extracts eigenvalues of unitary operators, foundational for many quantum algorithms.
- **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**: Finds the ground state energy of quantum systems.

### **Example: Implementing Grover’s Algorithm in Qiskit**

Grover’s algorithm finds a marked element in an unsorted database.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Initialize Qubits**:
   Start with \( n \) qubits in the \( |0\rangle \) state and apply a Hadamard gate to create a uniform superposition.

2. **Oracle**:
   Mark the solution state by flipping its phase.

3. **Grover Diffusion Operator**:
   Amplify the amplitude of the marked state.

4. **Measurement**:
   Measure the qubits to identify the marked state.

#### **Qiskit Implementation**

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.circuit.library import MCXGate
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Step 1: Create a quantum circuit
n = 3  # Number of qubits
qc = QuantumCircuit(n)

# Step 2: Apply Hadamard gates to all qubits
qc.h(range(n))

# Step 3: Oracle - Flip the phase of the solution state (e.g., |101>)
qc.x([0, 2])  # Flip qubits to match |101>
qc.h(n-1)
qc.mcx(list(range(n-1)), n-1)  # Multi-controlled NOT gate
qc.h(n-1)
qc.x([0, 2])

# Step 4: Grover Diffusion Operator
qc.h(range(n))
qc.x(range(n))
qc.h(n-1)
qc.mcx(list(range(n-1)), n-1)
qc.h(n-1)
qc.x(range(n))
qc.h(range(n))

# Step 5: Measure all qubits
qc.measure_all()

# Visualize the circuit
qc.draw('mpl')
```

counts = result.get_counts()

# Plot the results
plot_histogram(counts)
```
