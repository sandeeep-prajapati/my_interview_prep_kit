A Bell state is a specific type of entangled quantum state involving two qubits. There are four Bell states, but one of the most commonly used is the state \(|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|00\rangle + |11\rangle)\). In this state, both qubits are in a superposition of being either \(|00\rangle\) or \(|11\rangle\), which creates a strong correlation between their states.

### Entanglement
Entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics where the quantum states of two or more particles become intertwined such that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the state of the other(s), even when the particles are separated by large distances. In the case of Bell states, measuring one qubit will instantly determine the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them.

### Creating a Bell State in Qiskit

To create a Bell state using Qiskit, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a Quantum Circuit with Two Qubits.**
2. **Apply a Hadamard Gate (H) to the First Qubit.** This creates superposition.
3. **Apply a CNOT Gate (CX) with the First Qubit as the Control and the Second as the Target.** This creates entanglement.
4. **Measure the Qubits.**

Hereâ€™s the complete code to create and measure the Bell state \(|\Phi^+\rangle\):

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Create a quantum circuit with 2 qubits and 2 classical bits
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

# Step 2: Apply the Hadamard gate to the first qubit
qc.h(0)  # Create superposition on qubit 0

# Step 3: Apply the CNOT gate (0 is the control qubit, 1 is the target qubit)
qc.cx(0, 1)  # Create entanglement

# Step 4: Measure both qubits
qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

# Visualize the circuit
print("Quantum Circuit for Bell State:")
print(qc.draw())

# Step 5: Execute the circuit
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
job = execute(qc, backend, shots=1024)
result = job.result()

# Step 6: Get and visualize the measurement results
counts = result.get_counts()
print("Measurement results:", counts)
plot_histogram(counts)
plt.show()
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Creating the Quantum Circuit:**
   - We initialize a quantum circuit with 2 qubits and 2 classical bits for measurement.

2. **Hadamard Gate:**
   - The Hadamard gate is applied to the first qubit (qubit 0), transforming its state from \(|0\rangle\) to the superposition state \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle + |1\rangle)\).

3. **CNOT Gate:**
   - The CNOT gate is then applied, where qubit 0 is the control and qubit 1 is the target. If qubit 0 is \(|1\rangle\), it flips the state of qubit 1. This operation entangles the two qubits, resulting in the Bell state \(|\Phi^+\rangle\).

4. **Measurement:**
   - Finally, we measure both qubits, storing the results in the classical bits.

5. **Execution and Visualization:**
   - The circuit is executed using the QASM simulator, and the measurement results are displayed as a histogram.

### Expected Output
When you run the code, the measurement results will typically show two possible outcomes: \(|00\rangle\) and \(|11\rangle\), with approximately equal probabilities, confirming the creation of the Bell state. The histogram will display counts for these two outcomes.

### Conclusion
Creating a Bell state in Qiskit effectively demonstrates the concept of entanglement in quantum mechanics. By applying the Hadamard and CNOT gates, you can generate a state where the measurement of one qubit instantaneously reveals the state of the other, illustrating the non-classical correlations inherent in quantum systems.
