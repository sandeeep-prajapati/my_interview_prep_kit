### **What is Phase Kickback?**

**Phase kickback** is a quantum phenomenon where the phase of a controlled unitary operation \( U \) applied to a target qubit "kicks back" to the control qubit. This happens because the control qubit's phase is influenced by the eigenvalues of \( U \) acting on the target qubit.

This principle is essential in quantum algorithms such as **quantum phase estimation** and **Shor’s algorithm**, as it allows information about the unitary operator \( U \) to be encoded in the phase of the control qubit.

### **How Phase Kickback Works**

Given two qubits in the state \( |c\rangle|t\rangle \), where:
- \( |c\rangle \) is the control qubit,
- \( |t\rangle \) is the target qubit and an eigenstate of \( U \) with eigenvalue \( e^{i\phi} \), 

applying a controlled-\( U \) gate yields:
\[
|c\rangle|t\rangle \to e^{i\phi c}|c\rangle|t\rangle,
\]
where the phase \( \phi \) is applied to the control qubit if it is in state \( |1\rangle \).

### **Demonstrating Phase Kickback in Qiskit**

To illustrate phase kickback, we use:
1. A **Hadamard gate** to prepare the control qubit in superposition.
2. A **controlled-phase (CP) gate** to apply a phase to the target qubit conditioned on the control qubit.
3. Measure the final state to observe the phase kickback.

#### **Qiskit Implementation**

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Create a quantum circuit with 2 qubits
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)

# Step 1: Put the control qubit (qubit 0) in superposition
qc.h(0)

# Step 2: Prepare the target qubit (qubit 1) in the |1> eigenstate
qc.x(1)  # Apply an X gate to flip qubit 1 to |1>

# Step 3: Apply a controlled-U operation (e.g., Controlled-Phase Shift)
qc.cp(3.14159 / 2, 0, 1)  # Controlled Phase gate (π/2 phase shift)

# Step 4: Apply a Hadamard gate to the control qubit
qc.h(0)

# Step 5: Measure both qubits
qc.measure_all()

# Visualize the circuit
qc.draw('mpl')
```

### **Simulating the Circuit**

Run the circuit and observe the results.

```python
# Simulate the circuit
simulator = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator')
result = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1024).result()

# Get the measurement results
counts = result.get_counts()

# Plot the histogram
plot_histogram(counts)
```

### **Expected Results**

The control qubit's measurement outcomes will encode the phase information. For a phase shift of \( \pi/2 \), the interference pattern will reflect this phase kickback.

### **Detailed Explanation of Circuit**

1. **Hadamard on Control Qubit**:
   Creates the superposition:
   \[
   |+\rangle = \frac{|0\rangle + |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

2. **Controlled-Phase Gate**:
   Applies a phase of \( e^{i\pi/2} \) to the target qubit when the control qubit is \( |1\rangle \).

3. **Second Hadamard on Control Qubit**:
   Converts the phase information into a measurable amplitude difference.

### **Significance of Phase Kickback**

1. **Quantum Phase Estimation**:
   Phase kickback encodes the eigenphase of a unitary operator in a measurable form on the control qubit.

2. **Shor's Algorithm**:
   Key in finding periodicities by using phase estimation.

3. **Quantum Advantage**:
   Exploits interference patterns to extract global properties of a quantum state.

Phase kickback is a beautiful manifestation of the power of quantum interference, enabling core quantum algorithms to function.
