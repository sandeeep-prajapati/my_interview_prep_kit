### **Entanglement and Bell Pairs in Qiskit**

Entanglement is a key feature of quantum mechanics where qubits become correlated, such that the state of one qubit cannot be described independently of the other. A Bell pair is a simple example of an entangled state.

#### **Bell State Example**
One common Bell state is:
\[
|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{|00\rangle + |11\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

This state represents perfect quantum correlation.

### **Steps to Create and Measure a Bell Pair**

1. **Start with Two Qubits**:
   Initialize the qubits in the \( |0\rangle \) state.

2. **Apply a Hadamard Gate**:
   Put the first qubit into a superposition state:
   \[
   |+\rangle = \frac{|0\rangle + |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

3. **Apply a CNOT Gate**:
   Use the first qubit as the control and the second as the target to entangle the qubits:
   \[
   |\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{|00\rangle + |11\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

4. **Measure the Qubits**:
   Demonstrate correlation in the measurement outcomes.

### **Qiskit Implementation**

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Create a quantum circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)

# Step 1: Apply a Hadamard gate to qubit 0
qc.h(0)

# Step 2: Apply a CNOT gate with qubit 0 as control and qubit 1 as target
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Step 3: Measure both qubits
qc.measure_all()

# Visualize the circuit
qc.draw('mpl')
```

---

### **Simulating the Circuit**

```python
# Simulate the circuit
simulator = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator')
result = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1024).result()

# Get the measurement results
counts = result.get_counts()

# Plot the measurement histogram
plot_histogram(counts)
```

---

### **Expected Results**

The histogram should show outcomes \( 00 \) and \( 11 \) with equal probabilities (~50% each), demonstrating entanglement. This means measuring the first qubit in state \( |0\rangle \) ensures the second is also \( |0\rangle \), and measuring the first in \( |1\rangle \) ensures the second is \( |1\rangle \).

---

### **Proving Entanglement**

1. **Correlation**:
   The measurement results will always be perfectly correlated (either \( 00 \) or \( 11 \)).

2. **No Classical Explanation**:
   The correlation exists even if the measurements are separated by a large distance, defying classical physics explanations.

---

### **Extending to Other Bell States**

You can create other Bell states by modifying the initial Hadamard and CNOT gates:
- \( |\Phi^-\rangle = \frac{|00\rangle - |11\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \)
- \( |\Psi^+\rangle = \frac{|01\rangle + |10\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \)
- \( |\Psi^-\rangle = \frac{|01\rangle - |10\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \)

Example modification:
```python
qc.x(1)  # Apply an X gate to the second qubit to create a different Bell state.
```

Qiskit makes creating and measuring entangled states straightforward, demonstrating quantum mechanics' power in computation and communication.
