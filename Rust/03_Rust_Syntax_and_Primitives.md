### **Topic:** What Are Rustâ€™s Basic Syntax Rules, and How Do You Work with Primitive Data Types Like Integers, Floats, Booleans, and Characters?  

---

#### **1. Basic Syntax Rules in Rust**  

Rust's syntax emphasizes safety and clarity, with several unique features compared to other programming languages.  

##### **Key Syntax Rules**  
1. **Every program starts with a `main` function**:  
   - The `main` function is the entry point for Rust applications:  
     ```rust
     fn main() {
         println!("Hello, Rust!");
     }
     ```

2. **Semicolons (`;`) end statements**:  
   - Every statement must end with a semicolon unless itâ€™s the final expression in a function:  
     ```rust
     let x = 5; // Statement
     x + 1 // Expression (no semicolon)
     ```

3. **Variables are immutable by default**:  
   - Use `let` for immutable variables and `mut` to make them mutable:  
     ```rust
     let x = 10;       // Immutable
     let mut y = 20;   // Mutable
     y += 5;           // Allowed because `y` is mutable
     ```

4. **Type annotations are optional**:  
   - Rust can infer types but allows explicit type annotations:  
     ```rust
     let a: i32 = 42; // Explicit type annotation
     let b = 3.14;    // Type inferred as f64
     ```

5. **Ownership and borrowing**:  
   - Memory is managed through ownership rules, and values can only have one owner at a time unless borrowed.

6. **Blocks define scopes**:  
   - Variables declared in a block are scoped to that block:  
     ```rust
     {
         let scoped_var = 5;
         println!("{}", scoped_var);
     }
     // scoped_var is not accessible here
     ```

#### **2. Primitive Data Types in Rust**  

Rust provides several built-in primitive data types for common programming needs.  

##### **A. Integers**  
- Integers are signed (`i`) or unsigned (`u`) with different bit-widths:  
  - `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`  
  - `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`  
  - `isize` and `usize` depend on the system's architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).  

###### Example:  
```rust
fn main() {
    let signed_int: i32 = -100;   // Signed 32-bit integer
    let unsigned_int: u32 = 100; // Unsigned 32-bit integer
    println!("Signed: {}, Unsigned: {}", signed_int, unsigned_int);
}
```

##### **B. Floating-Point Numbers**  
- Floats represent numbers with decimal points. Rust supports `f32` and `f64` (default).  

###### Example:  
```rust
fn main() {
    let pi: f32 = 3.14;    // 32-bit floating point
    let e = 2.718;         // 64-bit floating point (default)
    println!("Pi: {}, e: {}", pi, e);
}
```

##### **C. Boolean**  
- Rust's boolean type is `bool`, which can have values `true` or `false`.  

###### Example:  
```rust
fn main() {
    let is_rust_fun: bool = true;
    if is_rust_fun {
        println!("Rust is fun!");
    }
}
```

##### **D. Characters**  
- Rustâ€™s `char` type is 4 bytes and supports Unicode, allowing it to store any character, including emojis.  

###### Example:  
```rust
fn main() {
    let letter: char = 'A';
    let emoji: char = 'ðŸ˜Š';
    println!("Letter: {}, Emoji: {}", letter, emoji);
}
```

---

#### **3. Variable Shadowing**  

- Shadowing allows a new variable with the same name to overwrite the previous one within a new scope.  
- The previous value is not mutated but replaced.  

###### Example:  
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let x = x + 2;  // Shadowing the previous `x`
    println!("x: {}", x); // Output: 7
}
```

---

#### **4. Type Conversion and Casting**  

Rust doesnâ€™t perform implicit type conversions; explicit casting is required using the `as` keyword.  

###### Example:  
```rust
fn main() {
    let integer = 42;              // Default type is i32
    let float = integer as f64;    // Explicit casting
    println!("Integer: {}, Float: {}", integer, float);
}
```

---

#### **5. Constants**  

Constants are immutable by default and must have explicit types. Use the `const` keyword for defining constants.  

###### Example:  
```rust
const PI: f64 = 3.14159;
fn main() {
    println!("The value of PI is {}", PI);
}
```

#### **6. Working with Literals**  

Rust supports numeric literals with various formats:  
- Decimal: `98_222` (underscores improve readability).  
- Hexadecimal: `0xff`.  
- Octal: `0o77`.  
- Binary: `0b1111_0000`.  

---

#### **7. Example Program: Using All Primitives**  
```rust
fn main() {
    let integer: i32 = 42;          // Integer
    let float: f64 = 3.14;          // Floating-point number
    let is_active: bool = true;     // Boolean
    let character: char = 'R';      // Character

    println!(
        "Integer: {}, Float: {}, Boolean: {}, Character: {}",
        integer, float, is_active, character
    );
}
```

#### **Conclusion**  
Rust's strong type system and memory safety rules make it an excellent language for writing robust, bug-free programs. Understanding its syntax and working with primitive types is a crucial first step toward mastering Rust.
