### **4. Set Up Shipping Rules Based on Weight**

Shipping costs can also depend on the weight of the items in the cart. You can configure rules to adjust the shipping rate based on the total weight of products being shipped.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Go to Shipping Rules:**
   - In the **Shipping method** section, go to **Shipping rules**.

2. **Add a New Shipping Rule:**
   - Click **+ Add** to create a new shipping rule for your chosen shipping method.

     - **Name**: Name of the rule (e.g., "Weight-Based Shipping").

3. **Configure Weight-Based Parameters:**
   - Set the **min/max weight range** (e.g., 0–5 kg).
   - Define the **cost** of shipping based on the weight range.
   - For example:
     - For orders weighing 0-5 kg, charge $5 for shipping.
     - For orders weighing 5-10 kg, charge $10 for shipping.
   - This allows for dynamic shipping costs based on the total weight of items in the cart.

You can further customize shipping costs by defining rules based on other parameters like order value, quantity of items, or customer group.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Go to Shipping Rules:**

     - **Customer Group**: Apply different shipping costs for different customer groups (e.g., wholesale customers vs. retail customers).
   
   Example rule configuration:
   - **Order Value-Based Rule**:
     - For orders above $100, offer free shipping.
     - For orders below $100, charge a flat rate of $10 for shipping.

After configuring the shipping methods and rules, it's important to test them to ensure they work correctly.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Place Test Orders:**
   - Test the checkout process by placing orders with varying shipping zones, weight, and values.
   
2. **Verify Shipping Costs:**
   - Ensure that the correct shipping costs are applied based on the defined rules. For example, if a customer in the U.S. orders 10 kg of products, the shipping cost should reflect the weight-based rule.

3. **Review Logs for Errors:**
   - If any issues arise, check the Aimeos logs for errors related to shipping calculations.
