Managing stock levels, backorders, and low-stock notifications in Aimeos involves configuring inventory management, setting up thresholds for low-stock notifications, and handling backorders when products are out of stock. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to manage these aspects effectively:

### **1. Enabling Stock Management in Aimeos**

Aimeos comes with built-in stock management that you can enable and configure for your products.

#### **A. Enable Stock Management**

Ensure that stock management is enabled in Aimeos by updating the `config/shop.php` configuration file.

```php
// config/shop.php

return [
    'stock' => [
        'enabled' => true, // Enable stock management
        'allow_backorders' => true, // Allow backorders for out-of-stock products
        'minimum_stock' => 10, // Minimum stock threshold for notifications
    ],
];
```

- **`enabled`**: Set to `true` to enable stock management.
- **`allow_backorders`**: If `true`, backorders will be allowed when the stock runs out.
- **`minimum_stock`**: Set a threshold to trigger low-stock notifications.

#### **B. Configuring Stock Levels for Products**

In the Aimeos admin panel, you can manage the stock levels for each product.

1. **Go to Admin Panel** → **Products** → **Edit Product**.
2. Find the **Stock** field and set the **Available Stock** (the number of units you have for the product).

Aimeos will automatically reduce the stock count when a customer places an order. It will also track when products are out of stock.

### **2. Handling Backorders**

Backorders allow customers to place orders even if the product is out of stock. Aimeos can automatically manage backorders, ensuring customers are notified and the system handles the order correctly.

#### **A. Enabling Backorders**

As mentioned earlier, enable backorders in the `config/shop.php` file by setting the `allow_backorders` flag to `true`:

```php
// config/shop.php
'stock' => [
    'allow_backorders' => true, // Enable backorders
],
```

#### **B. Displaying Backorder Status**

When a product is out of stock but backorders are allowed, you should display a message to customers, notifying them that the product can still be ordered.

You can customize the product page template to display this message. In the product details view (`resources/views/vendor/aimeos/shop/product/show.blade.php`), check if the product is out of stock but available for backorder:

```blade
@if($product->stock < 1 && config('shop.stock.allow_backorders'))
    <p class="text-warning">This product is out of stock but available for backorder.</p>
@endif
```

This will notify customers that the product is out of stock but can still be purchased.

### **3. Low-Stock Notifications**

To keep track of products running low on stock, you can set up notifications for when a product's stock reaches a certain threshold.

#### **A. Create a Custom Command for Low-Stock Alerts**

You can create a custom Laravel Artisan command to check stock levels and send low-stock notifications.

1. **Create a new Artisan command**:

```bash
php artisan make:command LowStockAlert
```

2. **Define the command logic** to check products with stock below the minimum threshold and send notifications:

```php
namespace App\Console\Commands;

use Illuminate\Console\Command;
use Aimeos\Shop\Models\Product;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

class LowStockAlert extends Command
{
    protected $signature = 'stock:low';
    protected $description = 'Send low-stock notifications for products';

    public function handle()
    {
        $threshold = config('shop.stock.minimum_stock');
        $products = Product::where('stock', '<', $threshold)->get();

        foreach ($products as $product) {
            $this->sendLowStockNotification($product);
        }

        $this->info('Low-stock notifications sent.');
    }

    private function sendLowStockNotification($product)
    {
        $email = 'admin@example.com'; // The recipient for the low-stock alert

        $data = [
            'product_name' => $product->name,
            'stock' => $product->stock,
            'threshold' => config('shop.stock.minimum_stock'),
        ];

        // Use Laravel's Mail facade to send the email
        Mail::send('emails.low_stock', $data, function ($message) use ($email) {
            $message->to($email)->subject('Low Stock Alert');
        });
    }
}
```

3. **Create the Email View**:

Create a new email view (`resources/views/emails/low_stock.blade.php`) to format the low-stock notification:

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Low Stock Alert</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Low Stock Alert</h1>
    <p>The following product is low in stock:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Product Name:</strong> {{ $product_name }}</li>
        <li><strong>Current Stock:</strong> {{ $stock }}</li>
        <li><strong>Threshold Stock:</strong> {{ $threshold }}</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

4. **Schedule the Command to Run Regularly**

Add this command to your `app/Console/Kernel.php` to schedule it to run regularly (e.g., daily or weekly):

```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->command('stock:low')->daily(); // Run the command daily
}
```

---

### **4. Handling Stock Updates After Order Completion**

Aimeos will automatically update the stock after an order is placed. However, if you want to track inventory on a custom basis, you can hook into Aimeos' order events.

#### **A. Using Aimeos Events for Stock Updates**

You can listen to order events and update the stock accordingly.

1. **Create an Event Listener** to listen for the `order` event:

```php
namespace App\Listeners;

use Aimeos\Shop\Events\OrderCompleted;
use Aimeos\Shop\Models\Product;

class UpdateStockAfterOrder
{
    public function handle(OrderCompleted $event)
    {
        foreach ($event->order->items as $item) {
            $product = Product::find($item->product_id);
            if ($product) {
                $product->decrement('stock', $item->quantity);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Register the Listener** in `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php`:

```php
protected $listen = [
    'Aimeos\Shop\Events\OrderCompleted' => [
        'App\Listeners\UpdateStockAfterOrder',
    ],
];
```

---

### **5. Monitoring and Managing Stock via Admin Panel**

The Aimeos admin panel provides a convenient interface for managing stock levels.

1. **Go to Admin Panel** → **Products** → **Edit Product**.
2. You will see fields for **Stock Quantity**, which you can adjust manually as needed.

You can also view the stock status for all products in the product listing and use filters to quickly identify products with low stock.

---

### **6. Displaying Stock Information on the Frontend**

It’s helpful to show stock information to customers, such as “In Stock”, “Out of Stock”, and “Low Stock” labels.

You can modify the product view template (`resources/views/vendor/aimeos/shop/product/show.blade.php`) to show the stock status:

```blade
@if($product->stock <= 0)
    <p class="out-of-stock">Out of stock</p>
@elseif($product->stock <= config('shop.stock.minimum_stock'))
    <p class="low-stock">Only a few left in stock!</p>
@else
    <p class="in-stock">In stock</p>
@endif
```

---

### **Conclusion**

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage stock levels, handle backorders, and set up low-stock notifications in Aimeos. The built-in tools in Aimeos, combined with custom commands and event handling in Laravel, give you the flexibility to manage inventory and ensure that stock levels are always up to date and visible to both admins and customers.
