Enabling product reviews and ratings on your product pages is an essential feature for any eCommerce site. It allows customers to leave feedback on products they've purchased, which can influence other shoppers' purchasing decisions. Aimeos provides an integrated review and rating system that can be easily configured for your products. Here’s a step-by-step guide to enable and customize this feature:

### **1. Enable Product Reviews and Ratings in Aimeos**

Aimeos includes a built-in review and rating feature that can be enabled with minimal configuration.

#### **A. Install the Required Aimeos Package**
To enable reviews and ratings, you must ensure that you have the correct Aimeos package installed. If not already done, install the `aimeos/shop` package via Composer:

```bash
composer require aimeos/aimeos-shop
```

This package includes the necessary components for product reviews and ratings.

#### **B. Enable the Reviews Feature**
Aimeos has a built-in feature to enable product reviews and ratings, which can be toggled in the backend configuration.

1. Open the `config/shop.php` file.
2. Look for the **Reviews** section and set the necessary configuration values to enable reviews for products.
   - Example:
   ```php
   'reviews' => [
       'enable' => true,   // Enable product reviews and ratings
       'moderate' => true, // Optional: Set to false to disable review moderation
   ],
   ```

### **2. Display Reviews and Ratings on Product Pages**

After enabling reviews and ratings, you need to display them on your product pages.

#### **A. Create a Review Section in Your Product Template**

You will need to modify the product detail page template to include the reviews and ratings section.

1. **Locate the Product Detail View**:
   - In your Laravel project, navigate to the product detail template. This is usually found in the Aimeos views directory under `resources/views/vendor/aimeos/shop/`.

2. **Add the Review Form and Display Section**:
   - You can add a section to display the reviews for each product and a form for customers to submit their own review.
   - Example code:
   ```blade
   <!-- Display Reviews -->
   <div class="product-reviews">
       <h3>Customer Reviews</h3>
       @foreach ($product->getReviews() as $review)
           <div class="review">
               <strong>{{ $review->getUser()->getName() }}</strong>
               <span>{{ $review->getRating() }} / 5</span>
               <p>{{ $review->getText() }}</p>
           </div>
       @endforeach
   </div>

   <!-- Review Submission Form -->
   <div class="review-form">
       <h4>Write a Review</h4>
       <form action="{{ route('shop.product.review', $product->getId()) }}" method="POST">
           @csrf
           <label for="rating">Rating (1-5):</label>
           <input type="number" name="rating" min="1" max="5" required>
           <textarea name="review" placeholder="Write your review here..." required></textarea>
           <button type="submit">Submit Review</button>
       </form>
   </div>
   ```

   - In the above example, replace `$product->getReviews()` with the method that retrieves reviews for the product in your system. This might depend on how Aimeos stores product reviews.

#### **B. Enable Review Submission**

To allow customers to submit reviews and ratings:

1. **Create a Controller for Handling Reviews**:
   - If not already set up, create a controller to handle the form submission and review creation process.

   Example `ReviewController.php`:
   ```php
   <?php

   namespace App\Http\Controllers;

   use Illuminate\Http\Request;
   use Aimeos\MShop\Product\Manager as ProductManager;
   use Aimeos\MShop\Review\Manager as ReviewManager;
   use Aimeos\Shop\Facades\Shop;

   class ReviewController extends Controller
   {
       public function store(Request $request, $productId)
       {
           // Validation
           $request->validate([
               'rating' => 'required|integer|min:1|max:5',
               'review' => 'required|string|max:1000',
           ]);

           // Get product
           $product = ProductManager::getProductById($productId);

           // Create review
           $review = ReviewManager::createReview([
               'rating' => $request->input('rating'),
               'text' => $request->input('review'),
               'user' => auth()->user(), // Assuming user is logged in
               'product' => $product,
           ]);

           // Redirect back to product page
           return redirect()->route('shop.product.show', $productId)
                ->with('success', 'Your review has been submitted!');
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Update Routes for Review Submission**:
   - In `routes/web.php`, add a route for submitting reviews:
   ```php
   Route::post('/product/{productId}/review', [ReviewController::class, 'store'])->name('shop.product.review');
   ```

### **3. Customize the Review and Rating System**

You may want to customize how reviews are handled and displayed to suit your needs. Here are some options you can consider:

#### **A. Moderation**
- You can choose to moderate reviews before they are visible to other customers. In the `config/shop.php` file, set the `moderate` option under `reviews` to `true`.
  ```php
  'reviews' => [
      'moderate' => true, // Set to false if you want to automatically publish reviews
  ],
  ```

#### **B. Review Summary**
- Display an average rating based on the ratings submitted by customers.
- Example:
  ```blade
  <div class="average-rating">
      <strong>Average Rating: {{ $product->getAverageRating() }} / 5</strong>
  </div>
  ```

#### **C. Star Rating Display**
- You can display star ratings in the frontend using simple HTML and CSS or JavaScript. Aimeos stores ratings as numeric values (e.g., 1-5), which can be displayed as stars.
  
  Example:
  ```blade
  <div class="stars">
      @for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++)
          <span class="star {{ $i <= $review->getRating() ? 'filled' : '' }}">&#9733;</span>
      @endfor
  </div>
  ```

#### **D. Sort Reviews**
- Allow customers to sort reviews by rating (e.g., "Most Helpful," "Newest," etc.). This can be achieved by adding filters in your review listing page.

### **4. Testing Your Review and Rating System**

Once you've set up the review and rating functionality, make sure to test:

1. Ensure users can submit a review with a rating and comment.
2. Check that reviews appear correctly on the product page.
3. Test moderation settings, if enabled, to verify that reviews are held for approval before being displayed.
4. Make sure the star ratings or average rating display works correctly.

### **Conclusion**

Enabling product reviews and ratings in Aimeos is an excellent way to improve customer trust and increase conversions. By following the steps above, you can quickly implement a review and rating system, customize it according to your needs, and allow customers to leave feedback on your products.
