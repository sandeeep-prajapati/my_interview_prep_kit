### **How to Create and Configure Products with Multiple Variants (e.g., Size, Color) in Aimeos**

Creating products with variants (like different sizes or colors) is essential for offering diverse choices to customers. Aimeos allows you to manage such products efficiently using attributes and product variations. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

Attributes define the options for your product variants (e.g., size, color).
