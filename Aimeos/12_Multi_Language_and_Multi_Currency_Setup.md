Configuring your site to handle different languages and currencies for international customers is crucial for expanding your eCommerce store’s reach and providing a localized shopping experience. Aimeos provides built-in tools to make this process seamless. Here's a step-by-step guide to configuring multi-language and multi-currency support for your site:

### **1. Configuring Multi-Language Support**

To support different languages on your Aimeos-powered store, follow these steps:

#### **A. Enable Language Support**

1. **Add Languages in Configuration**:
   - Open the `config/shop.php` file and find the language settings section.
   - Add the languages you want to support in your store. Aimeos supports many languages out-of-the-box, and you can easily add more.
   - Example:
     ```php
     'languages' => ['en', 'de', 'fr'], // English, German, and French
     ```

2. **Create Language Files**:
   - Aimeos uses language files to define text and labels on your site (e.g., “Add to Cart” button, checkout form labels).
   - These language files are located in the `resources/lang` directory of your Laravel project. For each language, there is a separate directory.
     - For example, you might have `resources/lang/en` for English, `resources/lang/de` for German, and `resources/lang/fr` for French.
   - If a language directory does not exist for the language you want to add, you can create it and translate the language strings.
   
3. **Set the Default Language**:
   - In the `config/shop.php` file, you can also define the default language for your store.
   - Example:
     ```php
     'default_locale' => 'en',
     ```

4. **Translate Content**:
   - Translate product descriptions, categories, and any other text content manually through the admin interface, or use a content management system (CMS) integrated with Aimeos to allow for multilingual input.

#### **B. Language Switcher in the Frontend**
- Aimeos provides an automatic language switcher for the frontend. You can enable a dropdown or flag icons to let users select their preferred language.
  - Example code for adding a language switcher in a Blade view:
    ```blade
    <div class="language-switcher">
        @foreach (config('shop.languages') as $lang)
            <a href="{{ route('shop.language', $lang) }}" class="language-{{ $lang }}">{{ strtoupper($lang) }}</a>
        @endforeach
    </div>
    ```

### **2. Configuring Multi-Currency Support**

To handle different currencies for international customers, follow these steps:

#### **A. Enable Currency Support**

1. **Add Currencies in Configuration**:
   - In the `config/shop.php` file, find the currencies section and add the currencies you want to support.
   - Example:
     ```php
     'currencies' => ['USD', 'EUR', 'GBP'], // US Dollar, Euro, and British Pound
     ```

2. **Set the Default Currency**:
   - You can define the default currency for your store in the same file.
   - Example:
     ```php
     'default_currency' => 'USD',
     ```

3. **Currency Conversion**:
   - For automatic currency conversion, you can integrate an external service like **Fixer.io** or **Open Exchange Rates**. 
   - Aimeos allows you to set the exchange rates for each currency manually, or you can configure it to fetch live exchange rates from an API.
   - Example of manually setting exchange rates:
     ```php
     'exchange_rates' => [
         'USD' => 1,
         'EUR' => 0.85,
         'GBP' => 0.75,
     ],
     ```

#### **B. Currency Switcher in the Frontend**
- Aimeos provides the functionality to switch currencies on your site. You can add a currency switcher similar to the language switcher.

  Example code for adding a currency switcher:
  ```blade
  <div class="currency-switcher">
      @foreach (config('shop.currencies') as $currency)
          <a href="{{ route('shop.currency', $currency) }}" class="currency-{{ $currency }}">{{ strtoupper($currency) }}</a>
      @endforeach
  </div>
  ```

#### **C. Handling Product Prices in Different Currencies**
- Ensure that your product prices are automatically converted based on the selected currency. Aimeos will handle this conversion based on the current exchange rates.
- You can also display the prices in different formats by customizing the frontend views if needed.

### **3. Configuring Shipping Rules for Multiple Regions**

To ensure smooth shipping for international customers, you’ll need to configure shipping rules based on zones or countries.

#### **A. Define Shipping Zones**
- You can set up different shipping rules for different regions or countries. For example, you can offer free shipping for domestic orders or charge extra fees for international deliveries.
- In the `config/shop.php` file, add your shipping zones:
  ```php
  'shipping_zones' => [
      'US' => ['shipping_cost' => 5, 'free_shipping_threshold' => 50],
      'EU' => ['shipping_cost' => 7, 'free_shipping_threshold' => 60],
      'International' => ['shipping_cost' => 15, 'free_shipping_threshold' => 100],
  ],
  ```

#### **B. Handle International Shipping Rates**
- Use the `Shipping` plugin in Aimeos to handle various shipping providers like **FedEx**, **DHL**, or **UPS**. This plugin can also help you set up advanced shipping methods like weight-based or location-based rates.

### **4. Handling Tax Configuration for Different Regions**

Different countries or regions may have different tax rates. Configuring taxes properly ensures that your international customers are charged the correct amount.

#### **A. Set Tax Rates Based on Location**
- In the `config/shop.php` file, you can define tax rates for different regions.
- Example:
  ```php
  'tax_rates' => [
      'US' => 0.07, // 7% tax for US
      'EU' => 0.20, // 20% VAT for EU
  ],
  ```

#### **B. Enable VAT and Tax Calculation**
- Aimeos allows you to calculate VAT for EU customers based on their location. You can enable this feature in the `config/shop.php` file and configure it according to your business needs.

### **5. Localizing Dates, Times, and Number Formats**

When operating in different countries, it's essential to format dates, times, and numbers according to local conventions.

#### **A. Date and Time Localization**
- Laravel handles localization for dates and times. You can use Laravel’s `Carbon` library to format dates in a locale-specific way.
  - Example:
    ```php
    use Carbon\Carbon;
    Carbon::setLocale('fr');
    echo Carbon::now()->translatedFormat('l j F Y');
    ```

#### **B. Currency and Number Formatting**
- You can use libraries like **Intl** or **NumberFormatter** in PHP to format currency and numbers according to the selected locale and currency.
  - Example:
    ```php
    $fmt = new \NumberFormatter('en_US', \NumberFormatter::CURRENCY);
    echo $fmt->formatCurrency(12345.67, 'USD');
    ```

### **6. Testing Your Multi-Language and Multi-Currency Configuration**

- Once you've configured everything, **test** the following:
  - Ensure that switching languages correctly changes the language of the product pages and checkout process.
  - Check that the selected currency updates the product prices and totals on the cart and checkout pages.
  - Test shipping rules and taxes to make sure the calculations are correct based on the customer’s location.

### **Conclusion**

By configuring multi-language and multi-currency support in Aimeos, you’ll provide an enhanced, localized shopping experience for your international customers. Be sure to test your configurations to ensure everything works smoothly, from language selection to currency conversion and region-specific shipping/tax calculations.
