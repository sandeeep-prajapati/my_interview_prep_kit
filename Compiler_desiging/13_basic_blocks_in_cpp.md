Dividing intermediate code into basic blocks is a crucial step in compiler optimization and analysis. A **basic block** is a straight-line code sequence with no branches except into the entry and out of the exit. Here's how you can implement a function in C++ to divide intermediate code into basic blocks, along with the necessary data structures to represent these blocks.

### Step 1: Define Intermediate Code Structure

We’ll start by defining a basic structure for intermediate code instructions and a representation for basic blocks.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <memory>

// Define types of TAC instructions
enum class TACOp {
    LABEL,
    JUMP,
    JUMP_IF_TRUE,
    JUMP_IF_FALSE,
    ASSIGN,
    ADD,
    SUB,
    MUL,
    DIV
};

// Intermediate representation of TAC instructions
struct TACInstruction {
    TACOp op;                  // Operation type
    std::string arg1;         // First operand
    std::string arg2;         // Second operand
    std::string result;       // Result of the operation

    // Print the TAC instruction
    void print() const {
        switch (op) {
            case TACOp::LABEL:
                std::cout << result << ":\n";
                break;
            case TACOp::JUMP:
                std::cout << "JUMP " << result << "\n";
                break;
            case TACOp::JUMP_IF_TRUE:
                std::cout << "JUMP IF TRUE " << arg1 << " TO " << result << "\n";
                break;
            case TACOp::JUMP_IF_FALSE:
                std::cout << "JUMP IF FALSE " << arg1 << " TO " << result << "\n";
                break;
            case TACOp::ASSIGN:
                std::cout << result << " = " << arg1 << "\n";
                break;
            case TACOp::ADD:
                std::cout << result << " = " << arg1 << " + " << arg2 << "\n";
                break;
            case TACOp::SUB:
                std::cout << result << " = " << arg1 << " - " << arg2 << "\n";
                break;
            case TACOp::MUL:
                std::cout << result << " = " << arg1 << " * " << arg2 << "\n";
                break;
            case TACOp::DIV:
                std::cout << result << " = " << arg1 << " / " << arg2 << "\n";
                break;
        }
    }
};

// Representation of a Basic Block
struct BasicBlock {
    std::string label;                          // Label for the block
    std::vector<TACInstruction> instructions;   // Instructions within the block
    BasicBlock(const std::string& lbl) : label(lbl) {}
};

// Basic Block Manager to handle block creation and storage
class BasicBlockManager {
public:
    void addBlock(std::shared_ptr<BasicBlock> block) {
        blocks.push_back(block);
    }

    void printBlocks() const {
        for (const auto& block : blocks) {
            std::cout << "Basic Block: " << block->label << "\n";
            for (const auto& instruction : block->instructions) {
                instruction.print();
            }
            std::cout << "\n";
        }
    }

private:
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<BasicBlock>> blocks; // List of basic blocks
};
```

### Step 2: Function to Divide Intermediate Code into Basic Blocks

Next, we'll implement a function that takes a list of TAC instructions and divides them into basic blocks.

```cpp
void divideIntoBasicBlocks(const std::vector<TACInstruction>& instructions, BasicBlockManager& blockManager) {
    std::shared_ptr<BasicBlock> currentBlock = nullptr;

    for (const auto& instruction : instructions) {
        switch (instruction.op) {
            case TACOp::LABEL:
                // If there's a current block, store it and start a new block
                if (currentBlock) {
                    blockManager.addBlock(currentBlock);
                }
                currentBlock = std::make_shared<BasicBlock>(instruction.result); // Start a new block
                currentBlock->instructions.push_back(instruction); // Add label to current block
                break;

            case TACOp::JUMP:
            case TACOp::JUMP_IF_TRUE:
            case TACOp::JUMP_IF_FALSE:
                // Add the instruction to the current block
                if (currentBlock) {
                    currentBlock->instructions.push_back(instruction);
                }
                // End the current block since it contains a jump
                if (currentBlock) {
                    blockManager.addBlock(currentBlock);
                    currentBlock = nullptr; // Reset current block
                }
                break;

            default:
                // If there's no current block, create one
                if (!currentBlock) {
                    currentBlock = std::make_shared<BasicBlock>(""); // Temporary label
                }
                currentBlock->instructions.push_back(instruction); // Add the instruction to the block
                break;
        }
    }

    // Add the last block if it exists
    if (currentBlock) {
        blockManager.addBlock(currentBlock);
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Example Usage

Now, let's create an example that uses the above code to divide a set of intermediate code instructions into basic blocks.

```cpp
int main() {
    // Sample intermediate code
    std::vector<TACInstruction> instructions = {
        {TACOp::LABEL, "", "", "block1"},
        {TACOp::ASSIGN, "a", "5", "x"},
        {TACOp::JUMP_IF_TRUE, "x", "", "block2"},
        {TACOp::ASSIGN, "b", "10", "y"},
        {TACOp::LABEL, "", "", "block2"},
        {TACOp::ASSIGN, "y", "20", "z"},
        {TACOp::JUMP, "", "", "end"},
        {TACOp::LABEL, "", "", "end"},
        {TACOp::ASSIGN, "z", "30", "result"}
    };

    BasicBlockManager blockManager;
    divideIntoBasicBlocks(instructions, blockManager);

    // Print the basic blocks
    blockManager.printBlocks();

    return 0;
}
```

### Step 4: Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the program, save the code in a single file, say `BasicBlockDivision.cpp`, and compile it using:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o basic_block_division BasicBlockDivision.cpp
./basic_block_division
```

### Expected Output

You should see output similar to this, representing the basic blocks:

```
Basic Block: block1
LABEL block1:
x = a + 5
JUMP IF TRUE x TO block2:
y = b + 10

Basic Block: block2
LABEL block2:
z = y + 20
JUMP end:

Basic Block: end
LABEL end:
result = z + 30
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **TACInstruction**: This structure represents each instruction in the intermediate code, which can include operations, jumps, and labels.

2. **BasicBlock**: This structure holds a label and a list of instructions that belong to that block.

3. **BasicBlockManager**: This class manages multiple basic blocks and provides functionality to add and print them.

4. **divideIntoBasicBlocks**: The core function iterates through the list of instructions, creating new blocks based on labels and jump instructions. When it encounters a label, it starts a new block; when it encounters a jump instruction, it finalizes the current block.

This code gives a basic structure to build upon for more complex compiler features, including optimizations and code generation. You can expand the types of operations and enhance the basic block management system based on the needs of your compiler.
