Building a Control Flow Graph (CFG) from basic blocks in C++ involves several steps. A CFG represents the flow of control in a program, where nodes represent basic blocks (straight-line code sequences with no branches), and edges represent the control flow paths between these blocks.

Here's a step-by-step approach to constructing a CFG and representing it using an adjacency list. This example will assume you have a simple program with a few basic blocks.

### Step 1: Define Basic Blocks

First, we need to identify the basic blocks in the program. For simplicity, let's consider the following C++ code snippet:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void exampleFunction(int x) {
    int a = 0;
    if (x > 0) {
        a = 1; // Block 1
    } else {
        a = -1; // Block 2
    }

    a += 10; // Block 3
    std::cout << a << std::endl; // Block 4
}
```

In this example, we can define the basic blocks as follows:
- **Block 1**: `a = 1;`
- **Block 2**: `a = -1;`
- **Block 3**: `a += 10;`
- **Block 4**: `std::cout << a << std::endl;`

### Step 2: Define the CFG Structure

We will represent the CFG using an adjacency list. Each basic block will be a node, and we will create edges based on the control flow of the program.

### Step 3: Create the Adjacency List

Here's how you can implement the CFG in C++ using an adjacency list:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

class ControlFlowGraph {
public:
    // Adjacency list representation
    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> adjList;

    // Method to add an edge
    void addEdge(const std::string& from, const std::string& to) {
        adjList[from].push_back(to);
    }

    // Method to display the CFG
    void display() {
        for (const auto& pair : adjList) {
            std::cout << "Block " << pair.first << " -> ";
            for (const auto& neighbor : pair.second) {
                std::cout << neighbor << " ";
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    ControlFlowGraph cfg;

    // Adding edges based on control flow
    cfg.addEdge("Block 0", "Block 1"); // Entry to Block 1
    cfg.addEdge("Block 0", "Block 2"); // Entry to Block 2 (else)
    cfg.addEdge("Block 1", "Block 3"); // From Block 1 to Block 3
    cfg.addEdge("Block 2", "Block 3"); // From Block 2 to Block 3
    cfg.addEdge("Block 3", "Block 4"); // From Block 3 to Block 4

    // Display the Control Flow Graph
    cfg.display();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `ControlFlowGraph` with an adjacency list implemented using an `unordered_map`. The keys are the basic block names (strings), and the values are vectors of strings representing the adjacent blocks.

2. **Adding Edges**: The `addEdge` method adds a directed edge from one block to another.

3. **Display Method**: The `display` method iterates through the adjacency list and prints the edges in a readable format.

4. **Main Function**: In the `main` function, we create an instance of `ControlFlowGraph`, add edges representing control flow, and display the graph.

### Output

When you run the program, the output will look like this:

```
Block Block 0 -> Block 1 Block 2 
Block Block 1 -> Block 3 
Block Block 2 -> Block 3 
Block Block 3 -> Block 4 
```

### Conclusion

This simple implementation demonstrates how to build a Control Flow Graph from basic blocks in a C++ program using an adjacency list. You can expand this by handling more complex control structures (like loops and function calls) and adding functionality for more advanced graph operations (like traversal algorithms).
