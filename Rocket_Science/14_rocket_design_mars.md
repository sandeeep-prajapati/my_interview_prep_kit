  - **Propellant**: RP-1 (kerosene) and liquid oxygen (LOX) for high thrust during liftoff.
  - **Total Thrust**: 3,000,000 N.

- **Payload Capacity**:  
  - **Low Earth Orbit (LEO)**: 100,000 kg.
  - **Mars Transfer**: 30,000 kg (after stage separation and EDS).

#### B. Stage 2: Mars Transfer Vehicle (MTV)

- **Configuration**:  
  - **Height**: Approximately 30 meters.
  - **Diameter**: 4 meters.
  - **Mass**: 200,000 kg (dry mass).

- **Propulsion**:  
  - **Engine**: Nuclear thermal engine for efficient long-duration burns (e.g., using hydrogen propellant).
  - **Total Thrust**: 75,000 N.
  - **Specific Impulse**: 850 seconds.

- **Payload Capacity**:  
  - Designed to carry crew (4-6 astronauts), scientific instruments, and habitats.

#### C. Optional Earth Departure Stage (EDS)

- **Configuration**:  
  - **Height**: 15 meters.
  - **Diameter**: 3 meters.
  - **Mass**: 50,000 kg.

- **Propulsion**:  
  - **Engine**: Single liquid rocket engine using hypergolic propellants (e.g., UDMH and N2O4) for reliability.
  - **Total Thrust**: 50,000 N.

### 3. Payload Design

**Crew Module**:
- **Capacity**: 4-6 astronauts.
- **Life Support Systems**: 
  - Oxygen generation system (using electrolysis).
  - CO2 scrubbers.
  - Water recovery and recycling.
  - Temperature and humidity control systems.
- **Radiation Shielding**: Multi-layered materials to protect against cosmic radiation.
  
**Scientific Payload**:
- **Instruments**: 
  - Spectrometers for analyzing Martian soil and atmosphere.
  - Cameras for surface imaging and navigation.
  - Robotics for sample collection.
- **Habitat Module**:
  - Pre-fabricated habitat for Mars surface operations.
  - Greenhouse for food production.

### 4. Life Support Systems

- **Atmospheric Control**: Continuous monitoring of oxygen and CO2 levels, with automatic adjustments.
- **Water Recovery**: Systems to purify and recycle water from human waste and moisture in the air.
- **Food Supply**: Initial food supply for the journey and sustainable systems for food production on Mars.
- **Medical Facilities**: Equipped with essential medical supplies and equipment for emergency care.

### 5. Mission Timeline

1. **Launch Window**: Every 26 months when Earth and Mars are optimally aligned.
2. **Launch**: Stage 1 launches from Earth, delivering the payload to LEO.
3. **Stage Separation**: Stage 1 separates, and EDS (if used) ignites to place the MTV on a trans-Martian trajectory.
4. **Cruise Phase**: 6-month journey with periodic trajectory corrections.
5. **Mars Orbit Insertion**: MTV enters Martian orbit; crew modules prepare for descent.
6. **Descent and Landing**: Use of landing rockets and parachutes for safe landing on Mars.
7. **Surface Operations**: Conduct scientific research, sample collection, and habitat setup.
8. **Return Phase**: Ascend from Mars to rendezvous with return vehicle in orbit.
9. **Return Journey**: 6-month journey back to Earth.

### 6. Conclusion

This design for a Mars mission rocket encompasses critical aspects such as payload capabilities, propulsion efficiency, and life support systems. It is aimed at ensuring the safety and success of crewed missions to Mars while enabling scientific exploration of the Martian environment. Future iterations could refine technology based on operational experience and research advancements.
