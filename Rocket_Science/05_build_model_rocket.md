Creating a model rocket with household materials and documenting its flight data is an exciting project that introduces the basics of rocketry. Here’s a step-by-step guide, including safety considerations, materials, building instructions, and how to record flight data. This project can be scaled up or down depending on your experience and access to materials.

### Safety First
- **Location**: Launch in an open area, away from trees, buildings, and crowds.
- **Personal Safety**: Always wear safety goggles and gloves when handling rocket engines or igniters.
- **Supervision**: Have adult supervision, especially if using ignition systems.
- **Legal Considerations**: Check local regulations regarding model rocket launches.

### 1. Gather Materials
For a basic model rocket, you’ll need:
- **Body Tube**: Cardboard tube (paper towel or wrapping paper tube).
- **Rocket Fins**: Stiff cardboard or thin plastic sheets.
- **Nose Cone**: Lightweight material like a plastic Easter egg half or a rolled paper cone.
- **Rocket Engine**: A commercially available model rocket engine (e.g., Estes A, B, or C class).
- **Launch Lug**: A small straw or similar tube for guiding the rocket on a launch rod.
- **Parachute Recovery System**: Plastic bag or tissue paper with string.
- **Ignition System**: Electronic igniter or battery-based ignition (often included with rocket engines).
- **Glue and Tape**: Hot glue or strong adhesive for assembly.
- **Launch Pad**: Can be a small metal or wooden base with a thin rod for guiding the rocket.

### 2. Build the Rocket

#### Step 1: Construct the Body Tube
1. **Cut the Tube**: Trim the cardboard tube to about 10-12 inches in length.
2. **Attach Launch Lug**: Glue a small piece of straw (about 1 inch long) along the side of the tube, near the bottom. This will guide the rocket on the launch rod.
   
#### Step 2: Attach the Fins
1. **Cut Out Fins**: Create 3 or 4 identical triangular fins from cardboard or plastic.
2. **Position the Fins**: Attach fins evenly around the base of the rocket (approximately 1-2 inches from the bottom). Make sure they are aligned for stability during flight.

#### Step 3: Add the Nose Cone
1. **Create or Attach the Cone**: If using a plastic cone, simply glue it to the top of the body tube. If using paper, roll it into a cone shape, trim to fit, and glue it to the top.
2. **Add Recovery System**: Attach a lightweight parachute or streamer made of plastic bag or tissue paper to the inside of the nose cone. Connect it to the body tube with string.

#### Step 4: Insert the Rocket Engine
1. **Secure the Engine**: Insert the engine into the base of the rocket, securing it with tape if necessary, so it doesn’t move during launch.
2. **Add Igniter**: Carefully insert the igniter into the engine according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

### 3. Launch the Rocket

#### Step 1: Set Up the Launch Pad
1. Place the rocket on the launch pad, threading the launch lug over the launch rod.
2. Ensure the launch pad is stable and directed vertically.

#### Step 2: Launch Procedures
1. **Connect the Ignition System**: Attach the ignition wires to the battery or launch controller.
2. **Safety Countdown**: Step back a safe distance (15 feet or more) and conduct a countdown.

#### Step 3: Launch!
1. Activate the ignition system to launch the rocket. Watch it ascend and record flight details if possible.

### 4. Documenting Flight Data

You can document the flight manually, or if you have access to simple electronic sensors, collect data on altitude, speed, and duration of flight.

#### Basic Data Recording
1. **Altitude Measurement**: Estimate the altitude by comparing the rocket’s peak height to nearby objects or using a simple altimeter app if available.
2. **Flight Time**: Use a stopwatch to measure the time from launch to peak altitude and to landing.
3. **Observations**: Record stability, trajectory, and any rotation during ascent.

#### Advanced Data Collection (Optional)
- **Use an Altimeter**: Miniature altimeters can fit inside the rocket to record altitude.
- **Accelerometer Module**: Small accelerometers (e.g., an Arduino-based sensor) can log acceleration, providing data for velocity and altitude calculations.
- **Smartphone Sensors**: If you have a small phone or GPS tracker, you might be able to fit it inside the rocket to record data.

### 5. Recovery and Analysis

After the rocket lands, recover it carefully. Document the following:

1. **Condition of Rocket**: Note any damage to the body, fins, or nose cone.
2. **Parachute Deployment**: Check if the parachute deployed correctly and how it affected the descent.
3. **Data Analysis**: Use any recorded data to calculate the rocket’s maximum altitude, velocity, and acceleration.

#### Example Calculations:
- **Altitude (using flight time)**: If you have only a rough time to apogee (peak height), use the formula:
  
  \[
  \text{Altitude} \approx \frac{1}{2} g t^2
  \]

  where \( g \) is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²) and \( t \) is the time to apogee.

### 6. Evaluate Performance and Refine the Design

1. **Assess Stability**: If the rocket didn’t fly straight, adjust the fin size, shape, or position to improve stability.
2. **Optimize Weight**: Reducing weight can improve altitude but be careful not to weaken structural integrity.
3. **Improve Recovery System**: Test different parachute sizes or materials to ensure a gentle descent.
