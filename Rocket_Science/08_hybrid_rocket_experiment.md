Designing and testing a hybrid rocket engine involves combining solid and liquid propellants to leverage their advantages: the simplicity and stability of a solid fuel with the controllability and specific impulse (efficiency) of a liquid oxidizer. Hybrid rockets use a solid fuel with a liquid or gaseous oxidizer. This approach provides both thrust control (by adjusting oxidizer flow) and improved safety due to the non-explosive nature of solid fuels without an oxidizer.

Here’s a detailed approach to designing, testing, and analyzing the combustion process of a hybrid rocket engine.

### Step 1: Define Design Parameters

**1. Thrust Requirements**
   - Determine the thrust and burn duration required for the mission.
   - **Example**: A small-scale hybrid rocket might require a thrust of around 500-1000 N and burn for 5-10 seconds.

**2. Propellant Selection**
   - **Solid Fuel**: Common choices include Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), paraffin wax, or rubber, which have high fuel density and ease of machining.
   - **Liquid Oxidizer**: Popular choices are Nitrous Oxide (N₂O) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX). N₂O is self-pressurizing and safer to handle.
   - **Example Combination**: HTPB as fuel and N₂O as the oxidizer.

**3. Combustion Chamber Design**
   - Design the combustion chamber to withstand the pressures and temperatures of combustion.
   - **Material**: High-temperature alloys like stainless steel or aluminum.
   - **Dimensions**: Based on desired thrust, burn rate, and fuel geometry (cylindrical with a central core to increase surface area for burning).

**4. Nozzle Design**
   - Design a converging-diverging nozzle (De Laval nozzle) to optimize thrust by allowing gases to expand and accelerate.
   - **Material**: Same as combustion chamber, with thermal insulation or ablative coatings to protect against extreme temperatures.
   - **Throat Diameter**: Calculate based on chamber pressure, desired exit velocity, and mass flow rate.

### Step 2: Theoretical Combustion Calculations

**1. Specific Impulse (Isp)**
   - Calculate the expected Isp to estimate the engine’s efficiency:
   \[
   I_{sp} = \frac{F}{\dot{m} \cdot g_0}
   \]
   where \( F \) is thrust, \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate, and \( g_0 \) is gravitational acceleration.

**2. Thrust Calculation**
   - Calculate thrust from the momentum equation:
   \[
   F = \dot{m} \cdot v_e + (P_e - P_0) \cdot A_e
   \]
   where \( v_e \) is exhaust velocity, \( P_e \) is pressure at the nozzle exit, \( P_0 \) is ambient pressure, and \( A_e \) is the nozzle exit area.

**3. Regression Rate of Solid Fuel**
   - Hybrid rockets burn from the surface, so understanding the regression rate (burning rate) of solid fuel is essential.
   \[
   r = a \cdot G_{ox}^n
   \]
   where \( G_{ox} \) is the oxidizer mass flux, and \( a \) and \( n \) are empirical constants determined experimentally.

### Step 3: Setting Up for Testing

#### Safety Precautions
   - Ensure a safe testing location, ideally in a controlled outdoor environment, with fire suppression systems.
   - Ensure all team members wear protective gear.

#### Test Stand Construction
   - Build a secure, rigid test stand to hold the rocket engine and measure thrust.
   - **Load Cell**: Install a load cell to measure thrust generated.
   - **Pressure and Temperature Sensors**: Position sensors to monitor chamber pressure and combustion temperature.

#### Fuel Grain Preparation
   - Fabricate the solid fuel grain (e.g., HTPB) with a cylindrical core to promote a consistent burn.
   - Seal the grain in the combustion chamber, ensuring proper alignment with the oxidizer inlet.

#### Oxidizer Delivery System
   - Use a pressurized tank with a flow control valve to deliver the oxidizer.
   - **Flow Control**: Incorporate a regulator and solenoid valve to start and stop oxidizer flow.

### Step 4: Conducting the Test and Collecting Data

**1. Ignition Sequence**
   - Use an electric igniter to initiate combustion at the fuel surface, which will then be sustained by the oxidizer flow.

**2. Data Collection**
   - Measure thrust over time using the load cell.
   - Record chamber pressure, temperature, and oxidizer flow rate throughout the burn.

**3. Monitoring Burn Characteristics**
   - Track the flame stability and check for any abnormal combustion, such as chugging (pressure oscillations) or incomplete combustion.

### Step 5: Analyze Combustion Performance

**1. Calculate Thrust Curve**
   - Plot thrust vs. time to analyze the engine’s performance. A stable thrust curve indicates successful combustion, while fluctuations suggest potential instability in the fuel regression or oxidizer flow.

**2. Specific Impulse and Efficiency**
   - Calculate the effective specific impulse from test data, comparing it to theoretical predictions.
   - Analyze the efficiency of combustion based on how close the actual Isp is to the expected value.

**3. Combustion Stability**
   - Evaluate data from pressure sensors to assess stability. Unstable combustion could mean inconsistent oxidizer flow or irregular burning of the fuel grain.

**4. Regression Rate Analysis**
   - Estimate the regression rate from the amount of fuel burned and the duration of combustion to check if it aligns with theoretical values.

### Step 6: Suggested Improvements Based on Results

**1. Fuel Grain Design Adjustments**
   - Modify the grain shape or size to achieve a more consistent burn rate if there are fluctuations in thrust or burn duration.

**2. Oxidizer Flow Rate Tuning**
   - Experiment with different oxidizer flow rates to optimize the balance between thrust and fuel efficiency.

**3. Enhanced Nozzle Design**
   - Adjust nozzle geometry to maximize exhaust velocity and improve specific impulse based on test results.

### Example Code for Thrust Analysis in Python

Using collected data, we can analyze thrust over time in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample test data (time in seconds, thrust in Newtons)
time = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])  # in seconds
thrust = np.array([0, 50, 200, 400, 500, 600, 580, 550, 500, 450, 0])  # in Newtons

# Plot thrust curve
plt.plot(time, thrust, label='Thrust over Time')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Thrust (N)')
plt.title('Thrust Curve for Hybrid Rocket Engine')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Calculate average thrust and specific impulse
average_thrust = np.mean(thrust[1:-1])  # exclude start and end values
burn_time = time[-2] - time[1]  # approximate burn time
specific_impulse = average_thrust * burn_time / (9.81 * burn_time)  # Isp calculation

print(f"Average Thrust: {average_thrust} N")
print(f"Specific Impulse: {specific_impulse:.2f} s")
```

This simple analysis can provide insight into the hybrid rocket’s performance and areas for improvement.

### Final Considerations

Conduct multiple tests to validate consistency and repeatability. Analyze each test to refine fuel geometry, adjust oxidizer flow rates, and optimize the nozzle. With this methodical approach, you’ll create a well-balanced hybrid rocket engine, documented with valuable test data for future design iterations.
