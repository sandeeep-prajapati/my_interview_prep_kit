Performing a thermal analysis of a rocket model during ascent and re-entry involves assessing the heat loads and temperatures experienced by the rocket as it moves through different atmospheric layers at high speeds. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software like ANSYS Fluent, COMSOL Multiphysics, or OpenFOAM can simulate these thermal effects and provide insights into temperature distributions and material stresses. Here’s a structured approach to conducting the analysis:

---

### Step 1: Define Analysis Parameters and Environment

**1. Rocket Model Geometry**
   - Model the rocket’s external shape, including the nose cone, fuselage, fins, and any protrusions (such as thrusters).
   - Simplify the geometry for computational efficiency, while retaining critical aerodynamic features.

**2. Flight Conditions**
   - **Ascent Phase**: Define parameters like initial velocity, altitude change, angle of attack, and acceleration.
   - **Re-entry Phase**: Set initial conditions for re-entry speed (often supersonic or hypersonic), angle, and altitude.
   - **Atmospheric Properties**: Use standard atmospheric models (e.g., International Standard Atmosphere) to define temperature, density, and pressure variations with altitude.

**3. Material Properties**
   - Assign thermal properties to each component of the rocket:
     - **Thermal Conductivity**
     - **Heat Capacity**
     - **Emissivity**: For surface radiation calculations.
   - Common materials include titanium alloys, aluminum, and ablative heat shields (e.g., carbon composites for nose cones).

**4. Boundary Conditions**
   - **Heat Flux**: Define convective and radiative heat flux on the surface.
   - **Initial Temperature**: Set an initial uniform temperature for the rocket structure, typically at ambient conditions.
   - **Radiation**: Consider radiation to space during ascent and to the atmosphere during re-entry.

### Step 2: CFD Simulation Setup

#### 1. Grid Generation (Meshing)
   - **Structured Mesh**: Use a fine mesh near the rocket’s surface to capture boundary layer effects accurately.
   - **Unstructured Mesh**: In outer regions, use a coarser mesh to reduce computation time.
   - Adaptive meshing around critical points, such as the nose cone and leading edges, will improve accuracy.

#### 2. Simulation Physics Model
   - **Compressible Flow**: Enable compressibility effects, essential for high-speed flight.
   - **Turbulence Modeling**: Choose a turbulence model (e.g., k-ω SST or LES for more accuracy) to simulate turbulent boundary layers.
   - **Thermal Model**: Enable conjugate heat transfer to capture heat conduction through the rocket’s structure, convection from the boundary layer, and radiation.

#### 3. Heat Transfer Boundary Conditions
   - **Convection**: Apply the convective heat transfer coefficient on the rocket’s surface, which changes with speed, altitude, and atmospheric density.
   - **Radiation**: Set up radiation boundary conditions to account for heat lost to space or the atmosphere, based on the material's emissivity.

### Step 3: Running Simulations for Ascent and Re-entry

#### Ascent Simulation
   - **Objective**: Analyze aerodynamic heating as the rocket accelerates through the atmosphere.
   - **Conditions**: 
     - Mach number increases as the rocket accelerates, producing heating from shock waves (especially near the nose cone and fins).
     - Gradually changing atmospheric density impacts the heat transfer rate.
   - **Output**: Temperature distribution across the rocket body, focusing on the nose cone and leading edges of the fins.

#### Re-entry Simulation
   - **Objective**: Assess the severe thermal loads caused by high-speed re-entry and atmospheric friction.
   - **Conditions**:
     - High Mach numbers and rapid deceleration induce strong shock waves and high surface temperatures.
     - Ablative materials on heat shields (if applicable) need to be modeled for material erosion due to intense heat.
   - **Output**: Temperature and heat flux distribution during peak heating periods, with special attention to thermal stresses on critical points like the nose cone.

### Step 4: Post-Processing and Analysis

**1. Temperature Distribution**
   - Visualize temperature contours on the rocket surface and examine peak heating areas.
   - Check the temperature at specific locations (e.g., nose cone tip, fin edges, body center) to identify hotspots.

**2. Heat Flux Analysis**
   - Analyze heat flux contours to understand the rate of heat transfer into the rocket structure.
   - Study variations in heat flux during ascent and re-entry to determine points of maximum thermal stress.

**3. Structural Analysis for Thermal Stresses**
   - Use temperature results as input for a structural analysis to evaluate thermal stresses due to expansion and contraction.
   - Focus on critical areas like joints and nose cone, where thermal expansion can induce high stress.

**4. Ablation Analysis (if applicable)**
   - For ablative materials, assess material erosion based on high-temperature zones, especially during re-entry.
   - Simulate mass loss and thickness reduction of the heat shield if a CFD-thermal-ablation coupling is available.

---

### Step 5: Optimizing Design Based on Results

**1. Material Selection**
   - Consider more heat-resistant materials or ablative heat shields if peak temperatures exceed current material limits.
   - Evaluate trade-offs between material weight and thermal protection to maintain overall rocket performance.

**2. Shape Modifications**
   - Modify the rocket’s nose cone and fin geometry to reduce drag and heating during high-speed phases.
   - Consider blunt or rounded edges for better thermal management during re-entry.

**3. Cooling Mechanisms**
   - Implement passive cooling techniques, like using ablative materials or heat sinks, in high-temperature areas.
   - Consider active cooling (e.g., regenerative cooling using liquid fuel as a coolant) for larger rockets or extended missions.

### Example Code for Initial Thermal Analysis in Python

Here’s an example of a simplified Python code to approximate temperature changes using the convective heat transfer approach. For exact simulations, use CFD software.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define constants and initial conditions
initial_temp = 300  # K (initial rocket surface temperature)
ambient_temp = 220  # K (approx. temperature at high altitudes)
h = 250  # W/m^2·K, convective heat transfer coefficient (approximate)
area = 2.0  # m^2, rocket surface area
mass = 80.0  # kg, rocket structure mass
specific_heat = 900  # J/kg·K

# Time simulation settings
time_step = 0.1  # seconds
total_time = 50  # seconds
time_points = np.arange(0, total_time, time_step)

# Temperature array to store results
temperatures = [initial_temp]

# Simulation loop
for t in time_points[1:]:
    # Calculate heat transfer rate (Newton's law of cooling)
    q_conv = h * area * (ambient_temp - temperatures[-1])
    # Temperature change
    delta_temp = (q_conv * time_step) / (mass * specific_heat)
    new_temp = temperatures[-1] + delta_temp
    temperatures.append(new_temp)

# Plotting temperature over time
plt.plot(time_points, temperatures, label='Surface Temperature')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Temperature (K)')
plt.title('Rocket Surface Temperature During Ascent')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Conclusion

This thermal analysis helps anticipate the thermal stresses and informs design improvements, such as selecting high-temperature materials, adjusting the rocket’s geometry, and incorporating thermal protection systems for re-entry. Each phase of the process, from simulation setup to post-processing, is essential for creating a robust rocket design capable of enduring the extreme conditions of ascent and re-entry.
