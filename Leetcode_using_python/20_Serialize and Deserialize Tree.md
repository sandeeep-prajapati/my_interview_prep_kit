### **Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree**

---

### **Prompt**  
**Goal**: Serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Serialization is the process of converting a binary tree into a string, and deserialization is the process of converting the string back into the original binary tree.

---

### **Trick**  
- Use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to serialize the tree.  
  - BFS helps to traverse the tree level by level.
  - Use `null` markers to represent absent children, ensuring the structure of the tree is preserved during deserialization.

---

### **Methodology**  

1. **Serialization**:  
   - Traverse the tree using BFS and store each node's value in a list.  
   - For each node, if itâ€™s `null`, add a special marker (e.g., `'null'`) to represent the missing child.  
   - Use a delimiter (e.g., a comma) to separate the node values in the serialized string.

2. **Deserialization**:  
   - Convert the serialized string back into a list of values.
   - Rebuild the binary tree by using the values from the list.
   - For each node, if the value is `'null'`, assign a `null` child; otherwise, create a new node.

3. **BFS for Deserialization**:  
   - Use a queue to help in level-order construction of the tree. Start with the root and iteratively build the tree.

### **Python Implementation**

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Codec:

    # Serialize the tree to a string
    def serialize(self, root: TreeNode) -> str:
        if not root:
            return ''
        
        result = []
        queue = [root]
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.pop(0)
            if node:
                result.append(str(node.val))
                queue.append(node.left)
                queue.append(node.right)
            else:
                result.append('null')
        
        # Join the list into a single string, separated by commas
        return ','.join(result)
    
    # Deserialize the string back into a tree
    def deserialize(self, data: str) -> TreeNode:
        if not data:
            return None
        
        nodes = data.split(',')
        root = TreeNode(int(nodes[0]))
        queue = [root]
        index = 1
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.pop(0)
            
            # Left child
            if nodes[index] != 'null':
                node.left = TreeNode(int(nodes[index]))
                queue.append(node.left)
            index += 1
            
            # Right child
            if nodes[index] != 'null':
                node.right = TreeNode(int(nodes[index]))
                queue.append(node.right)
            index += 1
        
        return root

# Example usage
codec = Codec()

# Constructing a simple binary tree
#        1
#       / \
#      2   3
#     / \   \
#    4   5   6
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)
root.right.right = TreeNode(6)

# Serialize the tree
serialized = codec.serialize(root)
print("Serialized Tree:", serialized)

# Deserialize the tree
deserialized = codec.deserialize(serialized)
print("Deserialized Tree Root Value:", deserialized.val)  # Output: 1
```

### **Key Points**  

1. **Serialization**:  
   - We use BFS to traverse the tree, appending the node values to a list.
   - Use `'null'` to represent missing children, ensuring that the tree's structure is preserved.
   - The final serialized string is a comma-separated string of node values.

2. **Deserialization**:  
   - Convert the serialized string back to a list of node values.
   - Using a queue, we rebuild the tree by adding left and right children based on the values from the list.

3. **Time Complexity**:  
   - Both serialization and deserialization have time complexity \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the tree.
   - This is because each node is processed exactly once in both the serialization and deserialization steps.

4. **Space Complexity**:  
   - The space complexity is \( O(n) \) for storing the serialized string and for the queue used during deserialization.

### **Example Walkthrough**

1. **Serialize the tree**:
   - Given the binary tree:
     ```
         1
        / \
       2   3
      / \   \
     4   5   6
     ```
   - Using BFS, we process the nodes level by level:
     - Start with the root: `1`
     - Add its children: `2`, `3`
     - Add the children of `2`: `4`, `5`
     - Add the child of `3`: `6`
     - Fill in the `null` markers for missing children at the next levels.
   - Result: `"1,2,3,4,5,null,null,null,null,6,null,null"`

2. **Deserialize the string**:
   - Split the string into a list: `["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "null", "null", "null", "null", "6", "null", "null"]`.
   - Rebuild the tree by processing each value:
     - Create the root with value `1`.
     - Add left child `2` and right child `3`, and so on.
   - The tree is reconstructed correctly.

This approach efficiently handles the problem of serializing and deserializing binary trees, ensuring that the structure and values are preserved.
