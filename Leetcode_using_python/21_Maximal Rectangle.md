### **Largest Rectangle of 1s in a Binary Matrix**

---

### **Prompt**  
**Goal**: Given a binary matrix, find the area of the largest rectangle containing only 1s.

---

### **Trick**  
- **Histogram-based Dynamic Programming (DP)**:  
  - Treat each row in the matrix as the base of a histogram.
  - For each row, calculate the height of the histogram and use the largest rectangle area algorithm for histograms.

---

### **Methodology**  

1. **Histogram Representation**:  
   - Convert each row of the binary matrix into a histogram where the height of each bar represents the number of consecutive 1s in that column up to the current row.

2. **Calculate Maximum Area for Each Row**:
   - For each row, calculate the largest rectangle that can be formed using the histogram representation (using a stack-based approach for maximum rectangle area in a histogram).
   - Update the histogram for each subsequent row.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Update the histogram heights progressively as you iterate through each row.
   - Use the maximum rectangle algorithm for histograms to compute the largest rectangle in each row.

---

### **Steps**:
1. For each row, if the element is `1`, increase the height of that column in the histogram. Otherwise, reset the height to 0.
2. Calculate the largest rectangle area that can be formed using the histogram for each row.
3. Keep track of the maximum area found during this process.

---

### **Algorithm**:
1. **Iterate through rows**:
   - Convert the current row into a histogram of heights.
2. **For each histogram**:
   - Use a stack to compute the largest rectangle area.
3. **Keep track of the largest rectangle** across all rows.

### **Python Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def maximalRectangle(self, matrix):
        if not matrix:
            return 0
        
        # Initialize variables
        n = len(matrix)
        m = len(matrix[0])
        heights = [0] * m  # This will store the histogram heights
        max_area = 0
        
        # Iterate through each row of the matrix
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                # If matrix[i][j] is '1', increase the height, else reset to 0
                heights[j] = heights[j] + 1 if matrix[i][j] == '1' else 0

            # Now, calculate the maximal area of rectangle for the current row's histogram
            max_area = max(max_area, self.largestRectangleInHistogram(heights))
        
        return max_area

    def largestRectangleInHistogram(self, heights):
        # Function to calculate the largest rectangle area in a histogram
        stack = []
        max_area = 0
        heights.append(0)  # Add a 0 to pop all remaining elements in the stack
        
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            while stack and heights[i] < heights[stack[-1]]:
                h = heights[stack.pop()]
                w = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
                max_area = max(max_area, h * w)
            stack.append(i)
        
        return max_area

# Example usage
matrix = [
  ["1", "0", "1", "0", "0"],
  ["1", "0", "1", "1", "1"],
  ["1", "1", "1", "1", "1"],
  ["1", "0", "0", "1", "0"]
]

sol = Solution()
print(sol.maximalRectangle(matrix))  # Output: 6
```

### **Explanation of the Code**:

1. **`maximalRectangle` Function**:
   - **Input**: A matrix of binary strings.
   - We initialize `heights` to a list of zeros, which represents the histogram for the first row.
   - For each row, we update the histogram heights. If the cell is `1`, we increment the height; if it's `0`, we reset the height to `0`.
   - After updating the histogram for the row, we compute the maximum area of the rectangle that can be formed using the `largestRectangleInHistogram` function.

2. **`largestRectangleInHistogram` Function**:
   - This function calculates the largest rectangle area for a given histogram (array of heights).
   - A stack is used to store indices of the bars in increasing height order.
   - When a smaller height is encountered, we pop the stack, calculate the area formed with the popped height as the shortest bar, and update the `max_area`.

3. **Output**: The function returns the largest rectangle area for the entire binary matrix.

### **Time Complexity**:
- **O(n * m)**:  
  - We iterate through each row (`n` rows) and for each row, we compute the largest rectangle in the histogram (`O(m)`), where `m` is the number of columns in the matrix.

### **Space Complexity**:
- **O(m)**:  
  - The space complexity is dominated by the `heights` array, which stores the histogram for each row (with a length of `m`).

### **Example Walkthrough**:

1. **Input**:  
   ```
   matrix = [
       ["1", "0", "1", "0", "0"],
       ["1", "0", "1", "1", "1"],
       ["1", "1", "1", "1", "1"],
       ["1", "0", "0", "1", "0"]
   ]
   ```

2. **Step-by-Step**:

   - **Row 1**: `[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]` → Heights: `[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]`
     - Largest rectangle: 1 (area is `1x1`).

   - **Row 2**: `[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]` → Heights: `[2, 0, 2, 1, 1]`
     - Largest rectangle: 2 (area is `2x1`).

   - **Row 3**: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` → Heights: `[3, 1, 3, 2, 2]`
     - Largest rectangle: 6 (area is `3x2`).

   - **Row 4**: `[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]` → Heights: `[4, 0, 0, 3, 0]`
     - Largest rectangle: 6 (area is `3x2`).

3. **Final Output**:  
   The largest rectangle area is `6`.

This approach efficiently calculates the maximum rectangular area of 1s in the binary matrix using dynamic programming and stack-based histogram techniques.
