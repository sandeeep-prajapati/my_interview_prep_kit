### **Generating All Permutations of a List of Numbers**

---

### **Understanding the Problem**
Given a list of distinct numbers, the task is to generate all possible permutations of that list. A permutation is any arrangement of the elements in the list.

---

### **Trick**
Use **backtracking** to explore all possible arrangements by:
1. Swapping elements.
2. Recursively generating permutations of the remaining elements.

---

### **Methodology**

#### **Backtracking Approach**
1. **Base Case**:
   - When the current list has been completely processed, return the list as one of the permutations.

2. **Recursion**:
   - For each element in the list, swap it with the current position and recursively generate permutations of the remaining list.
   - Backtrack by swapping back after the recursion step.

3. **Swap Mechanism**:
   - This avoids using extra space (like additional lists) and allows us to generate permutations in place.

---

### **Algorithm**
1. Define a helper function that takes the current list and an index as arguments.
2. Loop through each index starting from the current position.
3. Swap elements to create different arrangements.
4. Recursively generate permutations for the next index.
5. After the recursion, swap back to restore the original order (backtracking).

---

### **Python Code**

```python
def permute(nums):
    def backtrack(start):
        # Base case: If the current index is the last element, return the permutation
        if start == len(nums):
            result.append(nums[:])  # Append a copy of the current permutation
            return

        # Loop over the list to generate all permutations
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            # Swap the current index with the loop index
            nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]
            # Recur for the next index
            backtrack(start + 1)
            # Backtrack (swap back)
            nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]

    result = []
    backtrack(0)  # Start recursion from index 0
    return result
```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Input**:
`nums = [1, 2, 3]`

#### **Execution**:
1. **Start with index 0**: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Swap 1 with 1 (no change), recursively call for index 1.
   
2. **At index 1**: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Swap 2 with 2 (no change), recursively call for index 2.
   
3. **At index 2**: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Swap 3 with 3 (no change), reach the base case and add `[1, 2, 3]` to the result.
   
4. **Backtrack** to index 2, swap 3 with 3 again.

5. **Backtrack** to index 1, swap 2 with 3, then recurse for the next indices.

   - Add all permutations to the result through the recursive steps.

#### **Output**:
`[[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]`

### **Time and Space Complexity**
- **Time**: The number of permutations of `n` elements is \(O(n!)\). Each permutation involves \(O(n)\) operations (swapping and recursion), so the total time complexity is \(O(n \times n!)\).
- **Space**: The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for the recursion stack and \(O(n!)\) for storing the permutations.

---

### **Edge Cases**
1. **Empty List**:
   - Input: `nums = []`
   - Output: `[[]]` (the only permutation is the empty list itself).

2. **Single Element List**:
   - Input: `nums = [1]`
   - Output: `[[1]]` (only one permutation).

---

### **Optimization Tip**
- While this algorithm works efficiently for smaller input sizes, for large inputs (like lists with many elements), the sheer number of permutations (\(n!\)) grows very fast, so use it only for moderate-sized lists.

---

### **Conclusion**
This backtracking solution generates all permutations by systematically exploring each possibility. It ensures that no possible permutation is missed and leverages recursion and backtracking for efficient exploration. Let me know if you'd like further explanation or additional examples!
