### **Product of All Other Elements**

---

### **Prompt**  
**Goal**: Given an array `nums`, return an array `result` such that `result[i]` is the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`, without using division.

---

### **Trick**  
- **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**:  
  - The result for each element can be computed by multiplying the product of all elements before it (prefix) and the product of all elements after it (suffix).
  - This approach avoids the division operation and ensures an efficient solution in O(n) time.

---

### **Methodology**  
1. **Prefix Product Array**:
   - Create a new array where each element is the product of all elements before the current element.

2. **Suffix Product Array**:
   - Similarly, create another array where each element is the product of all elements after the current element.

3. **Final Result Array**:
   - Multiply the corresponding prefix and suffix values to get the final product for each index.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Instead of using two additional arrays (one for prefix products and one for suffix products), you can optimize the space complexity to O(1) by modifying the result array itself to store the prefix product, and then iterating from right to left to compute the suffix product.

---

### **Algorithm**:

1. **Step 1**: Calculate the prefix product for each element and store it in the result array.
2. **Step 2**: Traverse the array from right to left, updating the result array with the suffix product.

---

### **Python Implementation**:

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        result = [1] * n
        
        # Step 1: Calculate prefix products
        prefix = 1
        for i in range(n):
            result[i] = prefix
            prefix *= nums[i]
        
        # Step 2: Calculate suffix products and update result
        suffix = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            result[i] *= suffix
            suffix *= nums[i]
        
        return result

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.productExceptSelf([1,2,3,4]))  # Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

### **Explanation of the Code**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `result`: Initially, we create an array `result` filled with `1`s. This array will eventually hold the product of all other elements for each index.
   - `prefix`: A variable to keep track of the product of elements to the left of the current index.
   - `suffix`: A variable to keep track of the product of elements to the right of the current index.

2. **First Loop (Prefix Product)**:
   - We iterate from left to right, updating the `result[i]` with the `prefix` product and then updating `prefix` to include `nums[i]`.

3. **Second Loop (Suffix Product)**:
   - We iterate from right to left, updating the `result[i]` by multiplying it with `suffix` and then updating `suffix` to include `nums[i]`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The `result` array now contains the product of all elements except the element at each index.

---

### **Time Complexity**:
- **O(n)**: The algorithm involves two passes through the array, both taking linear time.

### **Space Complexity**:
- **O(1)** (excluding the output array): We only use a constant amount of extra space (the variables `prefix` and `suffix`), and the result array is considered part of the output.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**:

**Example 1**:
- **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- **Step 1**: Calculate the prefix products:
  - `result[0] = 1` (no elements before it)
  - `result[1] = 1` (product of elements before index 1: `1`)
  - `result[2] = 2` (product of elements before index 2: `1 * 2`)
  - `result[3] = 6` (product of elements before index 3: `1 * 2 * 3`)

- **Step 2**: Calculate the suffix products:
  - Start with `suffix = 1`.
  - Traverse from right to left:
    - `result[3] *= 1` (product after index 3: no elements)
    - `result[2] *= 4` (product after index 2: `4`)
    - `result[1] *= 12` (product after index 1: `4 * 3`)
    - `result[0] *= 24` (product after index 0: `4 * 3 * 2`)

- **Final Output**: `[24, 12, 8, 6]`

---

### **Edge Cases**:
1. **Single Element**:
   - If the array has only one element, there are no other elements to multiply, so the result should be `[1]`.
   
2. **Array with Zero**:
   - If the array contains zeros, the product for the corresponding indices will be zero. If more than one zero is present, the result for all indices will be zero.

3. **All Ones**:
   - If all elements in the array are `1`, the result will always be an array of `1`s, because the product of all other elements is always `1`.

This approach efficiently calculates the product of all other elements in O(n) time and O(1) space, making it optimal for large arrays.
