### **Trap Rainwater Problem**

---

### **Prompt**  
**Goal**: Given an array representing the elevation map where each element represents the height of a bar, compute how much water can be trapped between the bars after raining.

---

### **Trick**  
- **Two-pointer Technique**:  
  - Use two pointers to traverse the array from both ends (left and right).
  - Maintain the maximum heights encountered from the left and right sides while calculating trapped water.

---

### **Methodology**  
1. **Two pointers (`left` and `right`)**:
   - Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning (`left = 0`) and one at the end (`right = n - 1`) of the array.
   - Also, maintain two variables, `left_max` and `right_max`, to store the highest bars encountered from the left and right sides respectively.

2. **Conditions for Water Trapping**:
   - **If the bar at `left` is lower than the bar at `right`**:
     - Check if the height at `left` is greater than or equal to `left_max`. If it is, update `left_max`.
     - Otherwise, the trapped water at `left` is the difference between `left_max` and `height[left]`.
     - Move the `left` pointer to the right (`left++`).
   - **If the bar at `right` is lower than or equal to the bar at `left`**:
     - Check if the height at `right` is greater than or equal to `right_max`. If it is, update `right_max`.
     - Otherwise, the trapped water at `right` is the difference between `right_max` and `height[right]`.
     - Move the `right` pointer to the left (`right--`).

3. **End Condition**:
   - The loop continues until the `left` pointer is greater than or equal to the `right` pointer.

4. **Final Answer**:
   - The total trapped water is the sum of the water trapped at each position while traversing the array.

### **Algorithm**:

1. Initialize `left` and `right` pointers, `left_max` and `right_max`.
2. Use the two-pointer technique to calculate trapped water.
3. Sum the trapped water for each bar as you go along.

### **Python Implementation**:

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: list[int]) -> int:
        if not height:
            return 0
        
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        left_max, right_max = height[left], height[right]
        water_trapped = 0
        
        while left < right:
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                if height[left] >= left_max:
                    left_max = height[left]
                else:
                    water_trapped += left_max - height[left]
                left += 1
            else:
                if height[right] >= right_max:
                    right_max = height[right]
                else:
                    water_trapped += right_max - height[right]
                right -= 1
        
        return water_trapped

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.trap([0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]))  # Output: 6
```

### **Explanation of the Code**:

1. **Edge Case**:
   - If the input array `height` is empty, return `0` because no water can be trapped.
   
2. **Two-Pointer Setup**:
   - `left` starts at the beginning (`0`) and `right` starts at the end (`n-1`) of the array.
   - `left_max` and `right_max` are initialized to the heights of the bars at the leftmost and rightmost positions.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The `while` loop continues until `left` pointer crosses `right`.
   - If `height[left]` is smaller than `height[right]`, we process the left side, checking for trapped water, and then move `left` to the right.
   - If `height[right]` is smaller or equal, we process the right side, check for trapped water, and move `right` to the left.
   
4. **Water Calculation**:
   - If the current bar is shorter than the maximum height encountered from that direction, water can be trapped at that bar, and the difference between the max height and the current height gives the amount of trapped water.

5. **Final Result**:
   - The total trapped water is accumulated in `water_trapped`.

---

### **Time Complexity**:
- **O(n)**: The array is traversed once by the two pointers (`left` and `right`), and each pointer only moves in one direction.

### **Space Complexity**:
- **O(1)**: The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, as only a few variables are needed for tracking the pointers and maximum heights.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**:

**Example 1**:
- **Input**: `height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`
- **Steps**:
  - Initialize `left = 0`, `right = 11`, `left_max = 0`, `right_max = 1`, `water_trapped = 0`.
  - Iterate through the array with two pointers:
    - Move left pointer when `height[left] < height[right]` and calculate trapped water.
    - Move right pointer when `height[right] <= height[left]` and calculate trapped water.
  - Final total trapped water: `6`.
- **Output**: `6`

**Example 2**:
- **Input**: `height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]`
- **Steps**:
  - Initialize `left = 0`, `right = 5`, `left_max = 4`, `right_max = 5`, `water_trapped = 0`.
  - Follow the two-pointer technique and calculate trapped water.
  - Final total trapped water: `9`.
- **Output**: `9`

### **Edge Cases**:
1. **Empty Array**: Return `0` because no water can be trapped.
2. **Array with One Element**: Return `0` because no water can be trapped with a single bar.
3. **Decreasing Heights**: No water is trapped if the bars form a decreasing sequence (e.g., `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`).
4. **Increasing Heights**: No water is trapped if the bars form an increasing sequence (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).

This two-pointer approach efficiently calculates the trapped rainwater with a time complexity of **O(n)** and space complexity of **O(1)**, making it optimal for large inputs.
