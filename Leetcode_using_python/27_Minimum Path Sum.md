### **Minimum Path Sum in a Grid**

---

### **Prompt**  
**Goal**: Given a grid of size `m x n`, where each cell contains a non-negative integer, find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. The path can only move either down or right at any point in time. Return the minimum sum of the path.

---

### **Trick**  
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a DP table to accumulate the minimum cost to reach each cell, with transitions based on the minimum cost from either the cell above or the cell to the left.

---

### **Methodology**  
1. **Initialization**:
   - Start by initializing a DP table where `dp[i][j]` will represent the minimum path sum to reach the cell `(i, j)` from the top-left corner `(0, 0)`.
   
2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For any cell `(i, j)`, you can reach it either from the cell directly above `(i-1, j)` or from the cell directly to the left `(i, j-1)`. So, the formula is:
     \[
     dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + \min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
     \]
   - For the top row (`i = 0`), you can only come from the left.
   - For the leftmost column (`j = 0`), you can only come from the top.
   
3. **Final Result**:
   - The answer will be stored in `dp[m-1][n-1]`, which is the minimum sum to reach the bottom-right corner.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Instead of using a full 2D DP table, you can optimize the space complexity to O(n) by using a single row (since you only need the current row and the previous row at any point).

### **Algorithm**:

1. **Step 1**: Initialize the DP array for the first row and the first column.
2. **Step 2**: Fill the DP table based on the recurrence relation.
3. **Step 3**: Return the value in the bottom-right corner of the DP table.

### **Python Implementation**:

```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        # Initialize the dp array with the same dimensions as the grid
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        
        # Step 1: Fill in the top-left corner
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
        
        # Step 2: Fill the first row (can only come from the left)
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j]
        
        # Step 3: Fill the first column (can only come from the top)
        for i in range(1, m):
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]
        
        # Step 4: Fill the rest of the dp table
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
        
        # Step 5: Return the result in the bottom-right corner
        return dp[m-1][n-1]

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.minPathSum([[1,3,1], [1,5,1], [4,2,1]]))  # Output: 7
```

### **Explanation of the Code**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize a 2D DP array `dp` with the same dimensions as the input grid. This will store the minimum path sum to reach each cell.
   
2. **Fill the Top-Left Corner**:
   - The value at `dp[0][0]` is simply the value of the grid at `(0, 0)` since this is the starting point.

3. **Fill the First Row**:
   - Since we can only move right on the top row, we accumulate the path sum from left to right.

4. **Fill the First Column**:
   - Similarly, for the left column, we can only move down, so we accumulate the sum from top to bottom.

5. **Fill the Rest of the Table**:
   - For the rest of the grid, we compute each cell by considering the minimum of coming from the left or from above.

6. **Return the Result**:
   - The final minimum path sum to the bottom-right corner is stored in `dp[m-1][n-1]`.

### **Optimized Space Complexity**:
- Instead of using a full 2D DP array, we can reduce the space complexity by using a 1D array for the current row, updating it as we go.

### **Optimized Python Implementation**:

```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        # Use a 1D dp array to store the current row's minimum path sums
        dp = [0] * n
        
        # Step 1: Fill the first row (can only come from the left)
        dp[0] = grid[0][0]
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[j] = dp[j-1] + grid[0][j]
        
        # Step 2: Fill the rest of the grid
        for i in range(1, m):
            # Update the first column (can only come from the top)
            dp[0] += grid[i][0]
            
            # Update the rest of the row
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[j], dp[j-1])
        
        # The result is now in the last element of dp
        return dp[n-1]

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.minPathSum([[1,3,1], [1,5,1], [4,2,1]]))  # Output: 7
```

### **Time Complexity**:
- **O(m * n)**: We need to fill in each cell of the grid once, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.

### **Space Complexity**:
- **O(n)**: We optimize the space to store only a 1D array that represents the current row's minimum path sums.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**:

**Example 1**:
- **Input**: `grid = [[1,3,1], [1,5,1], [4,2,1]]`
- **Step 1**: Initialize `dp[0][0] = 1`.
- **Step 2**: Fill the first row: `dp[0][1] = 4`, `dp[0][2] = 5`.
- **Step 3**: Fill the first column: `dp[1][0] = 2`, `dp[2][0] = 6`.
- **Step 4**: Calculate the rest of the grid using the recurrence relation:
  - `dp[1][1] = 6`, `dp[1][2] = 6`
  - `dp[2][1] = 8`, `dp[2][2] = 7`.
  
- **Final Output**: `7`

### **Edge Cases**:
1. **Single Row or Column**:
   - If the grid has only one row or column, the minimum path sum is just the sum of the elements.
   
2. **All Elements are Zero**:
   - If the grid consists entirely of zeros, the minimum sum path will be zero.

3. **Very Large Grids**:
   - The solution is efficient enough for large grids, as the time complexity is linear in terms of the number of cells.
