### Solidity `if-else` Statement

The `if-else` statement in Solidity is similar to other programming languages, allowing you to execute certain code based on a condition. Solidity supports both the basic `if` statement and `if-else` for conditional branching.

---

#### 1. **Syntax**
The basic syntax for an `if-else` statement is:

```solidity
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else if (anotherCondition) {
    // code to execute if the first condition is false and anotherCondition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if all conditions are false
}
```

- **`condition`**: A boolean expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`.
- You can have multiple `else if` conditions to handle various cases.

---

#### 2. **Example: Basic `if-else`**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IfElseExample {
    function checkNumber(uint num) public pure returns (string memory) {
        if (num < 10) {
            return "Number is less than 10";
        } else if (num == 10) {
            return "Number is equal to 10";
        } else {
            return "Number is greater than 10";
        }
    }
}
```

- In this example, the function `checkNumber` checks whether the input `num` is less than, equal to, or greater than 10.
- Based on the condition, it returns the appropriate message.

---

#### 3. **Example: Using `if-else` with `require`**

You can use `if-else` along with Solidity's error handling mechanisms, like `require` or `revert`, to enforce conditions in smart contracts.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Voting {
    uint public voterAge;

    function setVoterAge(uint age) public {
        if (age < 18) {
            require(false, "Voter must be at least 18 years old");
        } else {
            voterAge = age;
        }
    }
}
```

- If the provided age is less than 18, the contract throws an error using `require`.
- If the condition passes, the voterâ€™s age is updated.

---

#### 4. **Ternary Operator in Solidity**
Solidity also supports a shorthand version of the `if-else` statement called the **ternary operator**.

- **Syntax**:
  ```solidity
  condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```solidity
  function isEven(uint num) public pure returns (string memory) {
      return num % 2 == 0 ? "Even" : "Odd";
  }
  ```

  - This checks if the number is even or odd in a compact form.

---

### Summary of `if-else` Statement
- **`if`** checks a condition, and if it is `true`, the code block inside it is executed.
- **`else if`** provides additional conditions to check if the previous `if` was `false`.
- **`else`** is the fallback when all conditions are false.
- `require`, `assert`, and `revert` can be used in combination with `if-else` to enforce rules.
- The **ternary operator** provides a compact alternative to simple `if-else` statements.
