In Solidity, variables can be classified based on their scope and persistence. The three main types are **state**, **local**, and **global** variables:

### 1. **State Variables:**
   - **Definition:** State variables are permanently stored on the blockchain as part of the contract's state. These variables are declared at the contract level and persist between function calls.
   - **Scope:** They are accessible throughout the contract.
   - **Gas Cost:** Writing to state variables costs gas since it involves changing the blockchain state.
   - **Example:**
     ```solidity
     contract Example {
         // State variable (stored on blockchain)
         uint public count;

         function increment() public {
             count += 1;  // Modifying the state variable
         }
     }
     ```

### 2. **Local Variables:**
   - **Definition:** Local variables are defined inside functions and exist only for the duration of the function execution. Once the function execution completes, local variables are discarded and their values are not saved on the blockchain.
   - **Scope:** They are limited to the function they are declared in.
   - **Gas Cost:** No direct gas cost for declaring local variables, but computation and memory allocation do consume gas.
   - **Example:**
     ```solidity
     contract Example {
         function calculateSum(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint) {
             // Local variable (exists only during function execution)
             uint sum = a + b;
             return sum;
         }
     }
     ```

### 3. **Global Variables:**
   - **Definition:** Global variables are special variables provided by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that contain information about the blockchain, transactions, and the environment. These variables are not declared by the developer but are available for use in any function.
   - **Scope:** Available globally within the contract.
   - **Gas Cost:** Accessing some global variables like `block.timestamp` or `msg.sender` can have a gas cost, depending on the operation.
   - **Common Global Variables:**
     - **`msg.sender`**: The address of the entity that called the function.
     - **`msg.value`**: The amount of Ether (in wei) sent with the function call.
     - **`block.timestamp`**: The timestamp of the current block (in seconds).
     - **`block.number`**: The number of the current block.
     - **`tx.gasprice`**: The gas price of the current transaction.
   - **Example:**
     ```solidity
     contract Example {
         function getSender() public view returns (address) {
             // Global variable msg.sender gives the address of the function caller
             return msg.sender;
         }

         function getBlockTime() public view returns (uint) {
             // Global variable block.timestamp gives the current block timestamp
             return block.timestamp;
         }
     }
     ```

### Summary:
- **State Variables:** Stored permanently on the blockchain and can be modified or read by functions.
- **Local Variables:** Exist temporarily within a function, discarded after execution.
- **Global Variables:** Predefined variables provided by the EVM to get information about the blockchain and the current transaction context.
