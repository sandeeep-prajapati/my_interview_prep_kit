In Solidity, **structs** are user-defined data types that allow you to group related variables together. They are similar to classes in object-oriented programming and are useful for organizing complex data. Structs can contain different types of data, including other structs, arrays, and primitive types.

### Defining a Struct
To define a struct, you use the `struct` keyword followed by the name of the struct and its variables within curly braces.

**Syntax:**
```solidity
struct StructName {
    // Declare state variables
    dataType variableName;
    dataType variableName;
    ...
}
```

**Example:**
```solidity
struct Person {
    string name;
    uint age;
    address walletAddress;
}
```

### Using Structs
Once youâ€™ve defined a struct, you can create instances of it and use it in your smart contracts.

1. **Declaring a Variable of Struct Type:**
   You can declare a variable of the struct type just like any other data type.

   **Example:**
   ```solidity
   Person public person1; // Declare a public variable of type Person
   ```

2. **Initializing a Struct:**
   You can initialize a struct either directly or through a constructor or a function.

   **Example:**
   ```solidity
   contract Example {
       struct Person {
           string name;
           uint age;
           address walletAddress;
       }
       
       Person public person1;

       constructor() {
           person1 = Person("Alice", 30, 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Creating an Array of Structs:**
   You can create an array to store multiple instances of a struct.

   **Example:**
   ```solidity
   contract Example {
       struct Person {
           string name;
           uint age;
           address walletAddress;
       }

       Person[] public people; // Array to hold multiple Person structs

       function addPerson(string memory _name, uint _age, address _walletAddress) public {
           people.push(Person(_name, _age, _walletAddress)); // Add a new Person to the array
       }
   }
   ```

### Accessing Struct Properties
You can access the properties of a struct using the dot notation.

**Example:**
```solidity
contract Example {
    struct Person {
        string name;
        uint age;
        address walletAddress;
    }

    Person public person1;

    constructor() {
        person1 = Person("Alice", 30, 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890);
    }

    function getPersonName() public view returns (string memory) {
        return person1.name; // Accessing the name property of person1
    }
}
```

### Nested Structs
Structs can also contain other structs, allowing for more complex data structures.

**Example:**
```solidity
contract Example {
    struct Address {
        string city;
        string state;
    }

    struct Person {
        string name;
        uint age;
        Address addr; // Nested struct
    }

    Person public person1;

    constructor() {
        person1 = Person("Alice", 30, Address("Gorakhpur", "Uttar Pradesh"));
    }
}
```

### Summary
- **Structs** in Solidity are a powerful way to group related data together, making it easier to manage complex information.
- They can hold different data types, including other structs and arrays.
- Accessing and modifying struct properties is done using dot notation, and structs can be used to create arrays for managing multiple instances.

Structs enhance code readability and organization, making them a valuable tool in smart contract development.
