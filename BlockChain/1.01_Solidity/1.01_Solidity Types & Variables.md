### Solidity Types & Variables

#### 1. **Value Types**
Value types hold data directly and are copied when assigned or passed to functions. Some common value types include:

- **`bool`**: Represents true or false.
  - Example: 
    ```solidity
    bool isTrue = true;
    ```

- **`int` / `uint`**: Signed and unsigned integers, respectively. 
  - **`int`** can hold both positive and negative values, while **`uint`** can only hold positive values.
  - Size can range from `int8` / `uint8` to `int256` / `uint256`, in steps of 8.
  - Example:
    ```solidity
    int256 balance = -500;  // Signed integer
    uint256 supply = 1000;  // Unsigned integer
    ```

- **`address`**: Holds 20-byte Ethereum addresses. Has special member functions for sending Ether.
  - Example:
    ```solidity
    address myAddress = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890;
    ```

- **`bytes1` to `bytes32`**: Fixed-size byte arrays.
  - Example:
    ```solidity
    bytes32 data = 0xabcdef...;
    ```

- **`enum`**: User-defined type to define a set of named constants.
  - Example:
    ```solidity
    enum Status { Pending, Shipped, Delivered }
    Status orderStatus = Status.Pending;
    ```

#### 2. **Reference Types**
Reference types point to the data rather than holding it. They include arrays, structs, and mappings.

- **Arrays**: Can be fixed or dynamic-sized.
  - **Fixed size**:
    ```solidity
    uint[5] fixedArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    ```
  - **Dynamic size**:
    ```solidity
    uint[] dynamicArray = [1, 2, 3];
    ```

- **Structs**: Custom types that group variables.
  - Example:
    ```solidity
    struct Person {
        string name;
        uint age;
    }

    Person public person = Person("Alice", 25);
    ```

- **Mapping**: Data structures that store key-value pairs, where the key can be of a fixed size type.
  - Example:
    ```solidity
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    ```

#### 3. **Special Global Variables and Functions**
Solidity provides special global variables that give information about the blockchain and the transaction:

- **`msg.sender`**: The address of the account calling the contract.
- **`msg.value`**: The amount of Ether sent with the call.
- **`block.timestamp`**: The timestamp of the current block.
- **`block.number`**: The block number.

#### 4. **Default Values**
Each Solidity type has a default value if not initialized:
- `bool` defaults to `false`.
- `int` and `uint` default to `0`.
- `address` defaults to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.
- Arrays, mappings, and structs default to empty.

#### 5. **Data Location**
Reference types must declare their data location:
- **`storage`**: Persistent storage on the blockchain.
- **`memory`**: Temporary storage used during function execution.
- **`calldata`**: Read-only temporary storage, typically for function inputs.

Example:
```solidity
function setArray(uint[] memory myArray) public {
    // myArray is in memory
}
```

#### 6. **Constants and Immutables**
- **`constant`**: Variables that are assigned at compile-time and cannot be changed.
  ```solidity
  uint constant PI = 314;
  ```

- **`immutable`**: Variables that are assigned once during construction and cannot be modified afterward.
  ```solidity
  address immutable owner;
  constructor() {
      owner = msg.sender;
  }
  ```

#### 7. **Operators**
- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**` (exponentiation).
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
- **Logical Operators**: `&&` (and), `||` (or), `!` (not).
- **Bitwise Operators**: `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`, `~`.

This summary captures the essentials of Solidity types and variables.
