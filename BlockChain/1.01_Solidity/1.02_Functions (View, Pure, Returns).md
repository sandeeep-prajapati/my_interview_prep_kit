In Ethereum smart contracts (written in Solidity), functions can be categorized based on their interaction with the blockchain and their behavior in terms of modifying or reading state. Here's a breakdown of **`view`**, **`pure`**, and **`returns`** in Solidity:

### 1. **View Functions:**
   - **Purpose:** Functions marked as `view` indicate that they do not modify the contract's state. They are used to read data from the blockchain, but they cannot alter any state variables.
   - **Gas Cost:** These functions do not consume gas when called externally (e.g., through a call method) because they only read the state.
   - **Example:**
     ```solidity
     contract Example {
         uint public number = 42;

         // This is a view function, it reads the state variable `number`.
         function getNumber() public view returns (uint) {
             return number;
         }
     }
     ```

### 2. **Pure Functions:**
   - **Purpose:** Functions marked as `pure` cannot read or modify the contract's state. They are used for purely computational tasks that do not depend on state variables. They only rely on the function inputs to return a result.
   - **Gas Cost:** Like `view` functions, `pure` functions also do not consume gas when called externally, as they don't interact with the blockchain state.
   - **Example:**
     ```solidity
     contract Example {
         // This is a pure function, it only depends on the inputs.
         function add(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint) {
             return a + b;
         }
     }
     ```

### 3. **Returns Keyword:**
   - **Purpose:** The `returns` keyword is used in function declarations to specify the type of data that the function will return. The types inside `returns` define what the function will output.
   - **Example:**
     ```solidity
     contract Example {
         // Function that returns a uint
         function double(uint x) public pure returns (uint) {
             return x * 2;
         }
     }
     ```

### Summary:
- **View:** Reads the blockchain state without modifying it.
- **Pure:** Performs computations without reading or modifying the blockchain state.
- **Returns:** Specifies the data type that the function will return.
