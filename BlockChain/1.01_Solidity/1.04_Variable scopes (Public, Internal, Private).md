### Solidity Variable Scopes

Solidity provides several visibility specifiers that determine how and where variables and functions can be accessed. These are important for encapsulating data and controlling access within contracts. The four main visibility types are:

---

#### 1. **Public**
- **Accessible from:** 
  - Inside the contract.
  - Derived (inherited) contracts.
  - External (outside the contract via transactions).
  
- **Usage:** 
  - When you want a variable or function to be accessible from anywhere (both within the contract and outside).
  
- **Auto-generated Getter Function:**
  - For public state variables, Solidity automatically generates a getter function, allowing external access without writing additional code.
  
- **Example:**
  ```solidity
  contract MyContract {
      // Public state variable
      uint public x = 10;
  
      // Public function
      function setX(uint _x) public {
          x = _x;
      }
  }
  ```

  In the example, the variable `x` and the function `setX()` can be accessed both inside and outside the contract.

---

#### 2. **Internal**
- **Accessible from:** 
  - Inside the contract.
  - Derived (inherited) contracts.
  
- **Not accessible from:**
  - External contracts or users.
  
- **Usage:** 
  - Use `internal` for variables or functions that should only be available within the current contract and contracts that inherit from it. It is the default visibility for state variables if no specifier is given.
  
- **Example:**
  ```solidity
  contract Parent {
      // Internal variable
      uint internal data = 100;
  
      // Internal function
      function updateData(uint _data) internal {
          data = _data;
      }
  }
  
  contract Child is Parent {
      function modifyData() public {
          updateData(200);  // Allowed since `updateData` is internal
      }
  }
  ```

  In this case, `data` and `updateData` are only accessible within `Parent` and any contracts that inherit from `Parent`, such as `Child`.

---

#### 3. **Private**
- **Accessible from:** 
  - Inside the contract.
  
- **Not accessible from:**
  - Derived (inherited) contracts.
  - External contracts or users.
  
- **Usage:** 
  - Use `private` for variables or functions that should only be accessible within the contract in which they are defined. Even derived contracts cannot access private variables or functions directly.
  
- **Example:**
  ```solidity
  contract MyContract {
      // Private variable
      uint private secret = 42;
  
      // Private function
      function getSecret() private view returns (uint) {
          return secret;
      }
  
      function revealSecret() public view returns (uint) {
          return getSecret();  // Allowed, since it's within the same contract
      }
  }
  
  contract DerivedContract is MyContract {
      function attemptAccess() public view returns (uint) {
          // Cannot access `secret` or `getSecret()` directly here
          // return secret;    // This will give an error
          // return getSecret();  // This will also give an error
      }
  }
  ```

  In this case, `secret` and `getSecret` are only accessible inside `MyContract`, and even `DerivedContract` cannot access them.

---

#### 4. **External**
- **Accessible from:**
  - Only outside the contract (via transactions).
  
- **Not accessible from:**
  - Inside the contract (without using `this` keyword).
  
- **Usage:** 
  - External functions can only be called by other contracts or externally (e.g., via transactions), not from inside the same contract, unless they are explicitly invoked with the `this` keyword.
  
- **Example:**
  ```solidity
  contract MyContract {
      // External function
      function externalFunction() external pure returns (string memory) {
          return "External";
      }
  
      function callExternal() public view returns (string memory) {
          // Call external function using `this`
          return this.externalFunction();
      }
  }
  ```

  In this example, `externalFunction()` can be called from outside the contract (e.g., via transactions) or within the contract using the `this` keyword.

### Summary Table

| Visibility | Accessible Inside Contract | Accessible in Derived Contracts | Accessible Outside Contract |
|------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `public`   | ✔️                         | ✔️                              | ✔️                           |
| `internal` | ✔️                         | ✔️                              | ❌                           |
| `private`  | ✔️                         | ❌                              | ❌                           |
| `external` | ❌ (unless via `this`)      | ❌                              | ✔️                           |

These visibility specifiers help control access to variables and functions, allowing for better contract design and encapsulation in Solidity.
