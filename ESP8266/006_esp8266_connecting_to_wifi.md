### **Connecting ESP8266 to Wi-Fi**

#### 1. **Introduction**
- The ESP8266 is a powerful microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities, making it ideal for IoT applications.
- Connecting the ESP8266 to a Wi-Fi network can be done using AT commands for modules without a microcontroller or by using Wi-Fi libraries in the Arduino IDE for development boards like NodeMCU.

#### 2. **Connecting Using AT Commands**
- **AT Commands** are a set of instructions used to control the ESP8266 module from a host microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi).
- Make sure the ESP8266 is flashed with firmware that supports AT commands.

##### 1. **Setting Up the Serial Communication**
- Connect the ESP8266 to a serial interface (e.g., via UART) to send and receive AT commands.
- **Wiring**:
  - Connect **TX** of the ESP8266 to **RX** of the host microcontroller.
  - Connect **RX** of the ESP8266 to **TX** of the host microcontroller.
  - Ensure proper voltage levels (3.3V) are maintained.

##### 2. **Basic AT Commands for Wi-Fi Connection**
- Use a terminal program (e.g., PuTTY, Arduino Serial Monitor) to send commands to the ESP8266.
  
**Common AT Commands**:
1. **Check AT Command Response**:
   ```
   AT
   ```
   - Expected response: `OK`

2. **Connect to Wi-Fi Network**:
   ```
   AT+CWJAP="SSID","PASSWORD"
   ```
   - Replace `SSID` and `PASSWORD` with your network details.
   - Expected response: `OK` if successful.

3. **Check Connection Status**:
   ```
   AT+CWJAP?
   ```
   - Expected response: Displays current connected SSID.

4. **Test Network Connectivity**:
   ```
   AT+PING="google.com"
   ```
   - Expected response: `OK` followed by response time.

5. **Disconnect from Wi-Fi**:
   ```
   AT+CWQAP
   ```
   - Expected response: `OK`

#### 3. **Connecting Using Wi-Fi Libraries in Arduino IDE**
- For development boards like NodeMCU, you can easily connect to Wi-Fi using the built-in Wi-Fi library in the Arduino IDE.

##### 1. **Installing the ESP8266 Board in Arduino IDE**
- Go to **File** > **Preferences** and add the following URL to the **Additional Board Manager URLs**:
  ```
  http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
  ```
- Go to **Tools** > **Board** > **Boards Manager**, search for "ESP8266," and install the package.

##### 2. **Code Example for Connecting to Wi-Fi**
```cpp
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>  // Include the Wi-Fi library

// Replace with your network credentials
const char* ssid = "YOUR_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);          // Start the Serial communication
  delay(10);
  
  // Connect to Wi-Fi
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  
  Serial.print("Connecting to WiFi");
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");  // Print dots while connecting
  }

  Serial.println();
  Serial.println("Connected to WiFi!");
  Serial.print("IP Address: ");
  Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());  // Print the ESP8266 IP address
}

void loop() {
  // You can implement other functionalities here
}
```

##### 3. **Explaining the Code**
- **Include the Library**: `#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>` includes the Wi-Fi library necessary for managing Wi-Fi connections.
- **Define Credentials**: Replace `YOUR_SSID` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your actual Wi-Fi network credentials.
- **Initialize Serial Communication**: `Serial.begin(115200)` initializes the serial monitor for debugging.
- **Connect to Wi-Fi**: `WiFi.begin(ssid, password)` attempts to connect to the specified network.
- **Check Connection Status**: A while loop checks the Wi-Fi status until connected.
- **Display IP Address**: `WiFi.localIP()` retrieves and displays the ESP8266's IP address on the local network.

#### 4. **Handling Connection Failures**
- Implement a timeout mechanism to handle failed connections:
```cpp
unsigned long startAttemptTime = millis();

while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED && 
       millis() - startAttemptTime < 10000) { // 10 seconds timeout
  delay(500);
  Serial.print(".");
}
```
- If the connection fails, you can either retry connecting or enter a low-power state.

#### 5. **Conclusion**
- Connecting the ESP8266 to Wi-Fi can be accomplished using either AT commands or the Arduino Wi-Fi library, depending on the setup.
- Using the Arduino IDE provides a simpler and more flexible approach for development and testing.
- Once connected, the ESP8266 can communicate with various online services, making it an essential component for IoT applications.
