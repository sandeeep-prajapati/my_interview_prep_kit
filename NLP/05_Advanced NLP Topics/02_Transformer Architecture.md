The Transformer architecture is a highly effective model primarily used for natural language processing tasks. It was introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. The architecture is based on self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to weigh the significance of different words in a sentence irrespective of their position.

### Overview of Transformer Architecture

The Transformer model consists of two main components:
1. **Encoder**: Processes the input sequence and produces a representation.
2. **Decoder**: Takes the encoder's output and generates the output sequence.

#### Key Components of the Transformer

1. **Input Embeddings**: Converts input tokens (words) into dense vectors.
2. **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the position of tokens in the sequence since Transformers do not have a built-in sense of order.
3. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different words in the input sequence simultaneously.
4. **Feed-Forward Neural Network**: Applies a point-wise feed-forward network to each position.
5. **Layer Normalization**: Normalizes inputs for each layer to stabilize and speed up training.
6. **Residual Connections**: Helps in training deep networks by allowing gradients to flow through the network directly.

### Transformer Encoder

The Encoder consists of multiple identical layers (typically 6). Each layer has two main sub-layers:
1. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**
2. **Feed-Forward Neural Network**

Each sub-layer is followed by layer normalization and a residual connection.

#### Encoder Layer

```python
class EncoderLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, heads, dropout, forward_expansion):
        super(EncoderLayer, self).__init__()
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=embed_size, num_heads=heads)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_size)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_size)
        self.feed_forward = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(embed_size, forward_expansion * embed_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(forward_expansion * embed_size, embed_size)
        )
        self.dropout1 = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.dropout2 = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, x):
        attention = self.attention(x, x, x)[0]
        x = self.norm1(self.dropout1(attention) + x)
        forward = self.feed_forward(x)
        out = self.norm2(self.dropout2(forward) + x)
        return out
```

### Transformer Decoder

The Decoder is similar to the Encoder but has an additional multi-head attention mechanism to attend to the output of the Encoder.

#### Decoder Layer

```python
class DecoderLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, heads, dropout, forward_expansion):
        super(DecoderLayer, self).__init__()
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=embed_size, num_heads=heads)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_size)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_size)
        self.norm3 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_size)
        self.feed_forward = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(embed_size, forward_expansion * embed_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(forward_expansion * embed_size, embed_size)
        )
        self.dropout1 = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.dropout2 = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.dropout3 = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, x, enc_out):
        attention = self.attention(x, x, x)[0]
        x = self.norm1(self.dropout1(attention) + x)
        attention = self.attention(x, enc_out, enc_out)[0]
        x = self.norm2(self.dropout2(attention) + x)
        forward = self.feed_forward(x)
        out = self.norm3(self.dropout3(forward) + x)
        return out
```

### Complete Transformer Model

You can now combine the encoder and decoder to build the complete Transformer model.

```python
class Transformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, num_heads, num_encoder_layers, num_decoder_layers, forward_expansion, dropout):
        super(Transformer, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.ModuleList(
            [EncoderLayer(embed_size, num_heads, dropout, forward_expansion) for _ in range(num_encoder_layers)]
        )
        self.decoder = nn.ModuleList(
            [DecoderLayer(embed_size, num_heads, dropout, forward_expansion) for _ in range(num_decoder_layers)]
        )
        self.fc_out = nn.Linear(embed_size, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x, y):
        for layer in self.encoder:
            x = layer(x)
        for layer in self.decoder:
            y = layer(y, x)
        return self.fc_out(y)
```

### Training the Transformer

To train the Transformer model, you will typically use a dataset suitable for the task (e.g., machine translation, text generation) and follow standard training procedures (forward pass, loss computation, backpropagation).

### Summary

- The **Transformer architecture** is effective for various NLP tasks, relying on self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies.
- It consists of **encoder** and **decoder** layers, each employing multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, and layer normalization.
- Its architecture allows for parallelization during training, leading to faster convergence compared to traditional RNNs.

This overview provides a foundational understanding of the Transformer architecture, which can be further expanded upon based on specific applications, like machine translation or text summarization.
