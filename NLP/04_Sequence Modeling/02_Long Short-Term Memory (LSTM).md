### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** is a special type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to model sequential data and learn long-term dependencies by overcoming the problem of vanishing gradients, which often affects traditional RNNs. LSTM networks can remember information for long periods, making them effective for tasks like time series prediction, text generation, and language translation.

#### 1. **Key Components of LSTM**

An LSTM network consists of several layers of cells, and each cell has three key gates to control the flow of information:

- **Forget Gate** (`f_t`): Decides which information should be discarded from the previous cell state.
- **Input Gate** (`i_t`): Decides which values from the input should be updated in the current cell state.
- **Output Gate** (`o_t`): Determines the next hidden state to be passed to the next time step.

These gates allow LSTMs to control how much past information is remembered and how much new information is added.

#### 2. **LSTM Equations**

At each time step \( t \), the LSTM performs the following computations:

- **Forget Gate**:
  \[
  f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
  \]
  This gate decides which part of the previous cell state \( C_{t-1} \) should be forgotten.

- **Input Gate**:
  \[
  i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
  \]
  \[
  \tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)
  \]
  The input gate updates the cell state \( C_t \) based on new information.

- **Update the Cell State**:
  \[
  C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \tilde{C}_t
  \]

- **Output Gate**:
  \[
  o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
  \]
  \[
  h_t = o_t * \tanh(C_t)
  \]
  The output gate defines the new hidden state \( h_t \).

### 3. **PyTorch Implementation of LSTM**

Below is an implementation of an LSTM model in PyTorch. We will build a simple LSTM for spam detection, similar to the previous example but using LSTM instead of a feedforward neural network.

#### Step 1: **Data Preprocessing**
We start by preparing the data just like before.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Sample data
X = ["Free money now", "Hello friend", "Win a lottery prize", "Meeting at 3pm"]
y = [1, 0, 1, 0]  # 1 = spam, 0 = ham

# Convert text data into Bag-of-Words vectors
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X).toarray()

# Split into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_vec, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Convert data to PyTorch tensors
X_train = torch.tensor(X_train, dtype=torch.float32)
X_test = torch.tensor(X_test, dtype=torch.float32)
y_train = torch.tensor(y_train, dtype=torch.long)
y_test = torch.tensor(y_test, dtype=torch.long)
```

---

#### Step 2: **LSTM Model Definition**

We'll define the LSTM model using `nn.LSTM`, and then a fully connected layer will be used to output the final predictions.

```python
class LSTMSpamDetector(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_classes):
        super(LSTMSpamDetector, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_layers = num_layers
        
        # Define the LSTM layer
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        
        # Fully connected layer
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Initialize hidden state and cell state with zeros
        h0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).to(x.device)
        c0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).to(x.device)
        
        # LSTM forward pass
        out, _ = self.lstm(x, (h0, c0))
        
        # We only want the output for the last time step
        out = out[:, -1, :]
        
        # Fully connected layer
        out = self.fc(out)
        return out

input_size = X_train.shape[1]  # Number of input features (from BoW)
hidden_size = 64  # Number of LSTM hidden units
num_layers = 1  # Number of LSTM layers
num_classes = 2  # Spam or Ham

# Initialize the model
model = LSTMSpamDetector(input_size=input_size, hidden_size=hidden_size, num_layers=num_layers, num_classes=num_classes)
```

---

#### Step 3: **Loss and Optimizer**

The loss function (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`) and optimizer (`Adam`) are the same as in the previous example.

```python
# Loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
```

---

#### Step 4: **Training the Model**

The training loop involves passing data through the LSTM, calculating the loss, and updating the model's weights using backpropagation.

```python
# Training loop
num_epochs = 100

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    
    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(X_train.unsqueeze(1))  # Add batch dimension
    loss = criterion(outputs, y_train)
    
    # Backward pass and optimization
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    if (epoch+1) % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```

---

#### Step 5: **Evaluation**

Finally, we evaluate the trained model on the test data to check its performance.

```python
# Evaluate the model
model.eval()

with torch.no_grad():
    test_outputs = model(X_test.unsqueeze(1))
    _, predicted = torch.max(test_outputs, 1)
    accuracy = (predicted == y_test).sum().item() / len(y_test)
    
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')
```

### 4. **Understanding LSTM in PyTorch**

- **`nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)`**:
  - **input_size**: The number of expected features in the input.
  - **hidden_size**: The number of features in the hidden state.
  - **num_layers**: Number of stacked LSTM layers.
  - **batch_first=True**: If True, the input and output tensors are in the format (batch, seq, feature).
  
- **Hidden States and Cell States**:
  - We initialize the hidden and cell states with zeros at the beginning of the sequence.
  
- **Fully Connected Layer**:
  - After the LSTM layer, we apply a fully connected layer to predict the class.

### 5. **Conclusion**

LSTMs are powerful for capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them ideal for tasks like text classification, time series forecasting, and more. In this example, we saw how to implement an LSTM for spam detection using PyTorch.
