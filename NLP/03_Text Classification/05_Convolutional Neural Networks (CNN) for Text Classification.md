### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Text Classification

While CNNs are traditionally used for image data, they can also be highly effective for text classification tasks. The key idea is to treat the text as a one-dimensional sequence, similar to an image, and apply convolutional filters to capture local patterns such as word n-grams.

#### **Why Use CNN for Text?**
- **Local Feature Learning**: CNNs can learn local patterns, such as common phrases or word n-grams, in a sentence.
- **Efficiency**: CNNs are computationally efficient compared to recurrent models like LSTMs, making them faster to train on large datasets.
- **Robustness**: They can capture hierarchical features from text data and are robust to variations in sentence structure.

### Steps for Implementing CNN for Text Classification

1. **Data Preparation and Preprocessing**
2. **Word Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
3. **Convolutional Layers**: Applies multiple filters of varying sizes to capture n-gram features.
4. **Pooling Layers**: Reduces dimensionality and focuses on the most important features.
5. **Fully Connected Layers**: Classifies the learned features into output categories.
6. **Training and Evaluation**: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance.

### Example: **Text Classification Using CNN in PyTorch**

#### **Step 1: Import Libraries**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchtext.legacy import data, datasets
```

#### **Step 2: Data Loading and Preprocessing**

We will use the **IMDb** dataset for binary text classification (positive/negative reviews).

```python
# Define fields for text and labels
TEXT = data.Field(tokenize='spacy', tokenizer_language='en_core_web_sm', batch_first=True)
LABEL = data.LabelField(dtype=torch.float)

# Load IMDb dataset
train_data, test_data = datasets.IMDB.splits(TEXT, LABEL)

# Build the vocabulary (GloVe embeddings)
TEXT.build_vocab(train_data, max_size=25_000, vectors="glove.6B.100d", unk_init=torch.Tensor.normal_)
LABEL.build_vocab(train_data)

# Create iterators
train_iterator, test_iterator = data.BucketIterator.splits(
    (train_data, test_data), batch_size=64, device=torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'))
```

#### **Step 3: Define CNN Model**

We will use a simple CNN architecture with multiple convolutional filters, followed by max-pooling and fully connected layers.

```python
class CNNModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, num_filters, filter_sizes, output_dim, dropout, pad_idx):
        super(CNNModel, self).__init__()

        # Embedding layer (pretrained GloVe vectors)
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, padding_idx=pad_idx)
        self.embedding.weight.data.copy_(TEXT.vocab.vectors)

        # Convolutional layers with varying filter sizes
        self.convs = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.Conv2d(in_channels=1, out_channels=num_filters, kernel_size=(fs, embedding_dim))
            for fs in filter_sizes
        ])

        # Fully connected layer
        self.fc = nn.Linear(len(filter_sizes) * num_filters, output_dim)

        # Dropout for regularization
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, text):
        # text = [batch size, sentence length]

        # Apply embedding layer
        embedded = self.embedding(text)  # [batch size, sentence length, embedding dim]
        embedded = embedded.unsqueeze(1)  # Add channel dimension [batch size, 1, sentence length, embedding dim]

        # Apply convolution + ReLU + max pooling
        conved = [torch.relu(conv(embedded)).squeeze(3) for conv in self.convs]  # Apply each convolution
        pooled = [torch.max_pool1d(conv, conv.shape[2]).squeeze(2) for conv in conved]  # Max pooling

        # Concatenate pooled outputs and apply dropout
        cat = self.dropout(torch.cat(pooled, dim=1))  # [batch size, num_filters * len(filter_sizes)]

        # Fully connected layer
        return self.fc(cat)
```

#### **Step 4: Train the CNN Model**

```python
# Model parameters
vocab_size = len(TEXT.vocab)
embedding_dim = 100
num_filters = 100  # Number of filters for each convolution
filter_sizes = [3, 4, 5]  # Filter sizes to capture different n-gram patterns
output_dim = 1  # Binary classification (positive/negative)
dropout = 0.5
pad_idx = TEXT.vocab.stoi[TEXT.pad_token]

# Initialize model
model = CNNModel(vocab_size, embedding_dim, num_filters, filter_sizes, output_dim, dropout, pad_idx)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()

# Move to GPU if available
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model = model.to(device)
criterion = criterion.to(device)

# Training function
def train_model(model, iterator, optimizer, criterion):
    model.train()
    epoch_loss = 0
    epoch_acc = 0

    for batch in iterator:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        predictions = model(batch.text).squeeze(1)
        loss = criterion(predictions, batch.label)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        epoch_loss += loss.item()

    return epoch_loss / len(iterator)

# Training loop
num_epochs = 5
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    train_loss = train_model(model, train_iterator, optimizer, criterion)
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, Train Loss: {train_loss:.4f}')
```

#### **Step 5: Evaluate the Model**

```python
# Evaluation function
def evaluate_model(model, iterator, criterion):
    model.eval()
    epoch_loss = 0

    with torch.no_grad():
        for batch in iterator:
            predictions = model(batch.text).squeeze(1)
            loss = criterion(predictions, batch.label)
            epoch_loss += loss.item()

    return epoch_loss / len(iterator)

# Test the model
test_loss = evaluate_model(model, test_iterator, criterion)
print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}')
```

### Key Components of CNN for Text Classification:

1. **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors (e.g., GloVe or Word2Vec embeddings) for the model.
2. **Convolutional Layer**: Extracts local patterns (n-grams) by applying filters of varying sizes. Each filter captures features like bi-grams, tri-grams, etc.
3. **Pooling Layer**: Applies max-pooling to reduce the dimensionality and retain the most important features.
4. **Fully Connected Layer**: Combines the pooled features and outputs a classification decision (positive/negative).
5. **Dropout**: A regularization technique to prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.

### Advantages of CNN for Text Classification:

- **Captures Local Dependencies**: CNNs can effectively capture local dependencies and word n-grams, which is useful for understanding the sentiment in phrases and short text.
- **Efficient**: CNNs are computationally efficient compared to RNNs and LSTMs, making them suitable for large-scale datasets.
- **Parallelization**: Convolutional layers can be parallelized more easily than recurrent layers, leading to faster training times.
