Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to gather data on plant growth and build a predictive model using PyTorch to estimate plant growth (height, leaf size, etc.) based on environmental factors like light and water.

### 1. **Data Collection**

To predict plant growth, you’ll need to gather data on several environmental factors and their impact on plant growth. Key factors to measure include:

- **Light exposure** (in hours per day or light intensity in lux)
- **Water** (amount of water per day in liters or soil moisture levels)
- **Temperature** (in degrees Celsius)
- **Soil type** (categorized as different types: loam, clay, sand, etc.)

The target variable will be the plant’s growth, which could be measured in:
- **Height** (in centimeters)
- **Leaf size** (in square centimeters)

### Example Dataset Structure:

```csv
light_exposure, water, temperature, soil_type, plant_height, leaf_size
8, 1.5, 25, loam, 35.4, 15.2
12, 2.0, 22, clay, 45.1, 17.3
6, 1.2, 18, sand, 25.6, 10.7
...
```

### 2. **Install Required Libraries**

You’ll need to install PyTorch along with some common libraries like pandas and scikit-learn for data manipulation and preprocessing.

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

### 3. **Load and Preprocess the Data**

You will first load the dataset and preprocess it for training.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import torch
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('plant_growth_data.csv')

# Preview the dataset
print(data.head())

# Encode categorical variables (like 'soil_type')
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
data['soil_type'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(data['soil_type'])

# Define features (X) and target (y)
X = data[['light_exposure', 'water', 'temperature', 'soil_type']]
y = data[['plant_height', 'leaf_size']]

# Normalize the features for better performance
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

### 4. **Split the Data**

You’ll split the dataset into training and testing sets.

```python
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y.values, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Convert to PyTorch tensors
X_train = torch.tensor(X_train, dtype=torch.float32)
X_test = torch.tensor(X_test, dtype=torch.float32)
y_train = torch.tensor(y_train, dtype=torch.float32)
y_test = torch.tensor(y_test, dtype=torch.float32)
```

### 5. **Build a Predictive Model Using PyTorch**

Here, we’ll create a simple neural network using PyTorch to predict plant growth (height and leaf size) based on the environmental factors.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the neural network
class PlantGrowthPredictor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(PlantGrowthPredictor, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(4, 64)  # Input: 4 features (light, water, temp, soil type)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 2)  # Output: 2 target variables (height, leaf size)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

# Initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer
model = PlantGrowthPredictor()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()  # Mean Squared Error for regression
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
```

### 6. **Train the Model**

You’ll train the neural network on the training dataset using multiple epochs.

```python
# Train the model
epochs = 100
for epoch in range(epochs):
    model.train()  # Set model to training mode
    optimizer.zero_grad()  # Zero the gradients
    
    # Forward pass
    predictions = model(X_train)
    
    # Compute loss
    loss = criterion(predictions, y_train)
    
    # Backward pass and optimization
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    # Print loss at every 10th epoch
    if (epoch+1) % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```

### 7. **Evaluate the Model**

After training, you can evaluate the model’s performance on the test set.

```python
model.eval()  # Set model to evaluation mode
with torch.no_grad():  # No need to compute gradients during evaluation
    predictions = model(X_test)
    test_loss = criterion(predictions, y_test)
    print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss.item():.4f}')
```

### 8. **Visualize Predictions**

You can visualize the model’s predictions against actual plant growth values to assess performance.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Convert predictions and actual values back to NumPy
predictions_np = predictions.numpy()
y_test_np = y_test.numpy()

# Plot plant height
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.scatter(y_test_np[:, 0], predictions_np[:, 0], color='blue')
plt.xlabel('Actual Height')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Height')
plt.title('Actual vs Predicted Plant Height')

# Plot leaf size
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.scatter(y_test_np[:, 1], predictions_np[:, 1], color='green')
plt.xlabel('Actual Leaf Size')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Leaf Size')
plt.title('Actual vs Predicted Leaf Size')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### 9. **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how to collect data on plant growth under different environmental conditions, preprocess it, and use PyTorch to build a neural network that predicts plant growth based on environmental factors. The same approach can be scaled to more complex data and architectures, and improved by exploring other deep learning models, hyperparameter tuning, and additional features like humidity or soil pH.
