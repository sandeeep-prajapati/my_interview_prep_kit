### 3. **Implement a Blue-Green or Canary Deployment Strategy**
   - **Description**: Configure blue-green or canary deployments to roll out new application versions with minimal impact on users.
   - **Skills Practiced**: Rolling updates, Service management, Traffic splitting.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Use Kubernetes Deployments to manage two versions of the same application.
     - Implement a blue-green deployment where only one version is live at a time.
     - Try canary deployment by incrementally routing traffic to the new version using an Ingress controller like Istio or NGINX.

### 4. **Create a Kubernetes Logging and Monitoring System**
   - **Description**: Set up a logging and monitoring stack for Kubernetes using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana).
   - **Skills Practiced**: Monitoring, Observability, Kubernetes Metrics, Persistent Volumes.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Install Prometheus and Grafana to monitor cluster metrics and set up custom dashboards.
     - Configure EFK for logging and set up Fluentd to forward logs from Kubernetes nodes and pods.
     - Experiment with setting up alerts in Prometheus for pod failures, high CPU usage, etc.

### 5. **Set Up an Application with Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**
   - **Description**: Configure horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) for an application to dynamically adjust based on demand.
   - **Skills Practiced**: Horizontal scaling, Metrics Server, Kubernetes API.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Deploy a sample application and install the Metrics Server to gather resource usage data.
     - Create an HPA policy to scale pods based on CPU or memory usage.
     - Load test the application and observe how Kubernetes scales pods to maintain performance.

### 6. **Deploy a Stateful Application with Persistent Volumes**
   - **Description**: Deploy a stateful application (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, or Redis) to practice working with Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).
   - **Skills Practiced**: StatefulSets, Persistent Storage, Data backup.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Use `StatefulSets` to deploy the database with `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim` for data storage.
     - Set up replication for high availability and resilience.
     - Perform backup and restore operations for the application’s data.

---

### 7. **Deploy and Manage a Microservices Application**
   - **Description**: Deploy a multi-service application (e.g., an e-commerce platform) with several independent services, practicing service discovery and inter-service communication.
   - **Skills Practiced**: Microservices architecture, Service mesh, Network policies.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create `Deployments` for each microservice and use `Services` for inter-service communication.
     - Set up an Ingress controller to manage external access.
     - Optionally, add a service mesh like Istio for traffic management, circuit breaking, and retries.

---

### 8. **Implement RBAC and Network Policies for a Secure Cluster**
   - **Description**: Configure role-based access control (RBAC) and network policies to enforce security in your Kubernetes cluster.
   - **Skills Practiced**: Security, RBAC, Network Policies.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Set up roles and role bindings to limit access to certain resources within specific namespaces.
     - Define network policies to restrict communication between pods based on labels and namespaces.
     - Test policies by attempting access to restricted resources.

---

### 9. **Build a Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Environment**
   - **Description**: Set up a multi-cluster environment with two Kubernetes clusters (e.g., in different regions or clouds) to practice multi-cluster management.
   - **Skills Practiced**: Multi-cluster management, Federation, Disaster recovery.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Use a tool like `kubefed` or `Anthos` to set up federation for unified management of the clusters.
     - Configure cross-cluster service discovery and routing.
     - Test failover between clusters to simulate disaster recovery.

---

### 10. **Deploy an Application with Helm Charts**
   - **Description**: Use Helm to package, deploy, and manage Kubernetes applications, making it easier to update and version applications.
   - **Skills Practiced**: Helm, Versioned deployments, Kubernetes templating.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Write a Helm chart for an application with multiple components, including a frontend and backend.
     - Use templating in Helm for easy customization of parameters (e.g., resource limits).
     - Deploy the application and test rolling updates with versioned Helm releases.

   - **Skills Practiced**: Backup and restore, Disaster recovery, etcd.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Use Velero or a similar tool to back up Kubernetes resources and persistent data.
     - Store backups in an external cloud storage (e.g., S3).
     - Test restoration to a different cluster to simulate recovery from a disaster.

### 12. **Deploy a Service Mesh for Traffic Management**
   - **Description**: Set up a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) to manage, secure, and observe traffic between microservices.

   - **Tasks**:
     - Install Istio or Linkerd in your cluster and enable it for specific namespaces.
