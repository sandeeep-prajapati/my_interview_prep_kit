2. **Verify Your Account**: Google may ask you to verify your identity via SMS or email.

## Step 3: Create a New Project

1. **Access the Google Cloud Console**: After signing in, go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. **Click on "Select a Project"**: At the top of the dashboard, click on the project dropdown and select "New Project."
3. **Fill Out the Project Details**: Enter a name for your project and choose an organization if applicable. Click "Create."

## Step 4: Enable APIs and Services

1. **Navigate to the "API & Services" Section**: In the left-hand menu, click on "APIs & Services" and then "Library."
2. **Enable Required APIs**: Search for and enable any APIs you need for your project, such as Compute Engine API or Cloud Storage API.

## Step 5: Set Up IAM and Access Control

1. **Manage Permissions**: In the "IAM & Admin" section, you can add members and assign roles to manage access to your project.
2. **Set Up Service Accounts**: If your application needs to access other GCP services, create service accounts and grant them necessary permissions.

## Step 6: Start Using GCP Services

- **Explore the GCP Console**: Familiarize yourself with the dashboard and start exploring the various services available to you.
