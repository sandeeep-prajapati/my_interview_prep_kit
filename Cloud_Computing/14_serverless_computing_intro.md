### What is Serverless Computing?

Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. In this model, developers can write code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, allowing them to focus solely on building and deploying applications. 

Key features of serverless computing include:

- **Event-driven**: Serverless architectures are typically triggered by events, such as HTTP requests, file uploads, or database changes.
- **Automatic scaling**: The cloud provider automatically scales resources up or down based on demand.
- **Pay-as-you-go pricing**: Users are charged only for the compute time and resources consumed during the execution of their code, rather than for pre-allocated resources.

### Advantages of Serverless Computing

1. **Reduced Operational Overhead**: Developers can focus on writing code rather than managing servers or infrastructure.
2. **Automatic Scaling**: Serverless platforms automatically scale applications in response to incoming requests, ensuring optimal performance without manual intervention.
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for what you use; no need to maintain and pay for idle resources.
4. **Faster Time to Market**: Development can be accelerated by removing the complexities of server management, allowing for quicker deployment of features.
5. **Built-in High Availability**: Cloud providers typically offer built-in redundancy and availability features, reducing the need for complex setups.

### Limitations of Serverless Computing

1. **Cold Start Latency**: Serverless functions can experience latency during the initial invocation if they havenâ€™t been called for a while, due to the time taken to spin up the infrastructure.
2. **Vendor Lock-in**: Using serverless services can create dependencies on specific cloud providers, making it challenging to switch providers later.
3. **Limited Execution Time**: Most serverless platforms impose execution time limits (e.g., AWS Lambda has a maximum execution time of 15 minutes).
4. **Complexity in Debugging and Monitoring**: Debugging serverless applications can be challenging due to their distributed nature, and monitoring can require additional tools.
5. **Resource Limits**: Serverless functions may have limits on memory, execution time, and storage, which could impact performance for resource-intensive applications.

### Summary

Serverless computing offers significant advantages in terms of operational efficiency and cost management, but it also comes with limitations such as cold start latency and potential vendor lock-in. AWS Lambda and Azure Functions are two of the leading serverless platforms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The choice between them often depends on specific project requirements, existing infrastructure, and the cloud ecosystem a business is already using.
