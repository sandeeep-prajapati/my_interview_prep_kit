### What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON. Terraform enables the automation of infrastructure management, allowing developers to create, update, and version infrastructure resources in a consistent and repeatable manner.

### How Does Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Work?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice that involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. In IaC, infrastructure is defined in configuration files, which can be version-controlled and shared like application code. Key aspects of IaC include:

- **Declarative Configuration**: Users describe the desired state of the infrastructure, and Terraform determines the steps to achieve that state.
- **Execution Plan**: Terraform generates an execution plan that outlines the actions it will take to reach the desired state.
- **State Management**: Terraform maintains a state file that tracks the current state of the infrastructure, allowing it to manage changes effectively.
- **Automation**: Changes can be applied automatically, making it easier to manage complex environments.
