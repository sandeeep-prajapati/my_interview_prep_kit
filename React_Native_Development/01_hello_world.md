To build a simple React Native app that displays "Hello, World!" on the screen, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment
Before starting, ensure that you have React Native set up on your machine. You can follow the React Native [Getting Started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) guide for detailed instructions.

### 2. Create a New React Native Project
Run the following command to create a new React Native project:

```bash
npx react-native init HelloWorldApp
```

### 3. Navigate to the Project Directory
After creating the project, navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd HelloWorldApp
```

### 4. Modify the `App.js` File
Open the `App.js` file, which is the default entry point of the app. Replace its content with the following code to display "Hello, World!":

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Hello, World!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#333',
  },
});

export default App;
```

### 5. Run the App
Now, run the app on an emulator or physical device. Depending on your setup, use one of the following commands:

#### For iOS (on macOS):
```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```

#### For Android:
```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

### 6. View "Hello, World!" on the Screen
After running the app, you should see the text "Hello, World!" displayed at the center of the screen.

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **`import React from 'react'`**: Imports React, which is necessary to create components in React Native.
2. **`import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'`**: Imports the necessary components (`View` and `Text`) and the `StyleSheet` utility for styling.
3. **`const App = () => {...}`**: Defines the main component of the app, `App`, which returns JSX to render on the screen.
4. **`View`**: A container component used to layout other components. It works like a `div` in HTML.
5. **`Text`**: A component used to display text on the screen.
6. **`StyleSheet.create({...})`**: Creates a set of styles for the app, similar to CSS but using JavaScript.

This app is the simplest React Native app, and it can serve as a foundation for building more complex applications.
