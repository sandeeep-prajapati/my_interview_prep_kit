### Steps to Create an APK with Expo

Follow these steps to generate an APK for your React Native app using Expo. These notes assume you’re using Expo in a test environment and want to create a simple workflow for future use.

---

#### 1. **Prerequisites**
- **Expo CLI** installed globally: 
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```
- A **free Expo account**: [Sign up here](https://expo.dev/signup).
- **App configuration** in `app.json` or `app.config.js` (e.g., app name, slug, etc.).

---

#### 2. **Initialize Your Expo Project**
Make sure your project is already set up. If not, you can initialize one with:
```bash
expo init my-app
cd my-app
```

---

#### 3. **Ensure You're Using EAS Build**
Expo now uses **EAS Build** to generate APKs. If you haven’t already, install the EAS CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

---

#### 4. **Configure Expo App for EAS**
Run the following command to set up EAS for your app:
```bash
eas build:configure
```
- You'll be asked questions such as:
  - **Project linked to Expo account**: Log in if required.
  - **Application ID**: Provide a unique identifier (e.g., `com.yourname.mytodo`).
  - **Android/Expo Classic vs Managed Workflow**: Stick with the **Managed Workflow**.

---

#### 5. **Update `app.json` or `app.config.js`**
Ensure the app configuration file includes the following settings:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "My Todo App",
    "slug": "my-todo-app",
    "android": {
      "package": "com.yourname.mytodo",  // Replace with your unique app ID
      "versionCode": 1,                 // Increment for each new build
      "permissions": []                 // Optional: Define specific permissions
    }
  }
}
```

---

#### 6. **Build the APK**
Run the EAS build command for an APK:
```bash
eas build --platform android
```
- **Options You’ll Be Prompted For**:
  - **Profile**: Use `production` for release builds or `development` for test builds.
  - **Build Type**: Select `apk` for testing or `aab` for Play Store publishing.

---

#### 7. **Monitor the Build**
Once the build starts, you'll receive a link to monitor its progress on the Expo dashboard:
- **Example Link**: `https://expo.dev/accounts/<your-username>/projects/<project-name>/builds/<build-id>`

---

#### 8. **Download the APK**
When the build completes, you’ll get a downloadable link for the APK:
```plaintext
✔ Your APK is ready! Download it here: https://expo.dev/artifacts/<your-apk-link>
```
Click the link or copy-paste it into your browser to download.

---

#### 9. **Install the APK on Your Device**
To install the APK:
1. Transfer the APK file to your Android device via USB or a file-sharing method.
2. Enable **Install Unknown Apps** on your device.
3. Open the APK file to install the app.

---

#### 10. **Future Updates**
- **To create new builds**: Simply increment the `versionCode` in your `app.json` file.
- Use the same `eas build --platform android` command for subsequent builds.

---

### Notes for Testing Environment
- Use the `development` profile when running test builds.
- **Debug Logs**: For debugging errors during the build, check Expo’s build logs online.
- **Publishing to Play Store**: When ready to publish, switch to an `aab` build instead of an `apk`:
  ```bash
  eas build --platform android --type aab
  ```

This setup ensures a smooth APK generation process while keeping your app ready for future updates and releases.
