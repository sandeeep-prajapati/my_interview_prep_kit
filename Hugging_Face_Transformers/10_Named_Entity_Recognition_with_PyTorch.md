Using Hugging Face Transformers with PyTorch for Named Entity Recognition (NER) involves several steps, including loading a pre-trained model, preparing your data, and performing inference. Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing NER using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets
```

### Step 2: Load the Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer

For NER tasks, you can use models like `dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english`, which is pre-trained on the CoNLL-03 dataset.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification

# Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

### Step 3: Prepare Your Input Data

You need text input for which you want to extract named entities. Here’s a sample input text:

```python
text = "Hugging Face is creating a tool that democratizes AI. The company is based in New York."
```

### Step 4: Tokenize the Input

Tokenize the text, ensuring to get the appropriate input IDs and attention masks. You can also get the offsets for mapping the predictions back to the original tokens.

```python
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
input_ids = inputs["input_ids"]
attention_mask = inputs["attention_mask"]
```

### Step 5: Perform Inference

Use the model to get predictions for each token in the input.

```python
import torch

# Perform inference
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)

logits = outputs.logits
```

### Step 6: Decode the Predictions

Get the predicted class indices and convert them to their corresponding entity labels.

```python
# Get predicted class indices
predictions = torch.argmax(logits, dim=2)

# Map the predicted indices to their corresponding labels
predicted_labels = [model.config.id2label[p.item()] for p in predictions[0]]

# Print the results
for token, label in zip(tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids[0]), predicted_labels):
    if label != "O":  # O means "Outside" of a named entity
        print(f"{token}: {label}")
```

### Full Code Example

Here’s the complete code wrapped together:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification

# Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Sample text for NER
text = "Hugging Face is creating a tool that democratizes AI. The company is based in New York."

# Tokenize the input
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
input_ids = inputs["input_ids"]
attention_mask = inputs["attention_mask"]

# Perform inference
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)

logits = outputs.logits

# Get predicted class indices
predictions = torch.argmax(logits, dim=2)

# Map the predicted indices to their corresponding labels
predicted_labels = [model.config.id2label[p.item()] for p in predictions[0]]

# Print the results
for token, label in zip(tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids[0]), predicted_labels):
    if label != "O":  # O means "Outside" of a named entity
        print(f"{token}: {label}")
```

### Step 7: Running the System

You can run the complete code in a Python environment where PyTorch and Transformers are installed. Modify the `text` variable to test with different inputs.

### Summary
1. **Load the Pre-trained Model**: Use a model fine-tuned for NER tasks.
2. **Prepare Input Data**: Define the text input for which you want to extract entities.
3. **Tokenize the Input**: Convert the text into the appropriate format for the model.
4. **Perform Inference**: Use the model to get predictions for the input tokens.
5. **Decode the Predictions**: Map the predicted indices to entity labels and display the results.

This system demonstrates a basic implementation of Named Entity Recognition using Hugging Face Transformers with PyTorch, allowing you to identify named entities in text inputs effectively.
