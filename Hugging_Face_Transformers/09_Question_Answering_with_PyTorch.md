Building a question-answering system using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch involves several steps, including loading a pre-trained model, preparing the dataset, and implementing the inference logic. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a simple question-answering system:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets
```

### Step 2: Load the Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer

For question answering tasks, you can use models like `distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad`, which is fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForQuestionAnswering

# Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

### Step 3: Prepare Your Input Data

You need a context (text) and a question for the model to generate an answer. Here’s a sample context and question:

```python
context = """The Transformers library is a powerful tool for natural language processing (NLP).
It provides a wide variety of pre-trained models and tools to fine-tune them for specific tasks.
Developed by Hugging Face, Transformers support models like BERT, GPT, and many others."""
question = "What is the Transformers library used for?"
```

### Step 4: Tokenize the Input

Tokenize the context and question, making sure to obtain the appropriate input IDs and attention masks.

```python
inputs = tokenizer.encode_plus(question, context, return_tensors="pt")
input_ids = inputs["input_ids"]
attention_mask = inputs["attention_mask"]
```

### Step 5: Perform Inference

Use the model to get the start and end logits for the answer span in the context.

```python
# Perform inference
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)

start_logits = outputs.start_logits
end_logits = outputs.end_logits
```

### Step 6: Decode the Answer

Find the indices of the start and end of the answer from the logits and decode them into text.

```python
import torch

# Get the predicted start and end indices
start_index = torch.argmax(start_logits)
end_index = torch.argmax(end_logits) + 1  # Include the end index

# Convert input IDs back to tokens
answer_tokens = input_ids[0][start_index:end_index]
answer = tokenizer.decode(answer_tokens)

print(f"Question: {question}")
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```

### Full Code Example

Here’s the complete code wrapped up together:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForQuestionAnswering

# Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Sample context and question
context = """The Transformers library is a powerful tool for natural language processing (NLP).
It provides a wide variety of pre-trained models and tools to fine-tune them for specific tasks.
Developed by Hugging Face, Transformers support models like BERT, GPT, and many others."""
question = "What is the Transformers library used for?"

# Tokenize the input
inputs = tokenizer.encode_plus(question, context, return_tensors="pt")
input_ids = inputs["input_ids"]
attention_mask = inputs["attention_mask"]

# Perform inference
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)

start_logits = outputs.start_logits
end_logits = outputs.end_logits

# Get the predicted start and end indices
start_index = torch.argmax(start_logits)
end_index = torch.argmax(end_logits) + 1  # Include the end index

# Convert input IDs back to tokens
answer_tokens = input_ids[0][start_index:end_index]
answer = tokenizer.decode(answer_tokens)

print(f"Question: {question}")
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```

### Step 7: Running the System

You can run the complete code in a Python environment where PyTorch and Transformers are installed. Modify the `context` and `question` variables to test with different inputs.

### Summary
1. **Load the Pre-trained Model**: Use a model fine-tuned for question answering.
2. **Prepare Input Data**: Define the context and question.
3. **Tokenize the Input**: Convert the context and question into the appropriate format.
4. **Perform Inference**: Use the model to get logits for the answer.
5. **Decode the Answer**: Find the indices of the predicted answer and convert them back to text.

This system demonstrates a basic implementation of question answering using Hugging Face Transformers with PyTorch, allowing you to ask questions based on the provided context.
